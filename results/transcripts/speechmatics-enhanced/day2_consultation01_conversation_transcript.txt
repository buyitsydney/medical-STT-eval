Hi there . Good morning . Um , I'm doctor Gene from Babylon . Hi . Can you hear me ? Okay . Yeah , I can hear you . Fine . Yeah . Okay . Great . Well , nice to see you this morning . Um , before we start your appointment , could I confirm your full name and date of birth , please ? Uh , yeah . Uh , Jack Smith , uh , 31st of October , 1990 . That's perfect . Thank you . Jack , um , are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment ? Um , yes . Okay , great . So , um , tell me what's been going on . You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing . Is that right ? Yes . I just feel like I can't really hear as well as I used to like . My hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way . Right . Okay . How long has this been going on for ? About six weeks . Six weeks ? Okay . Um , and before that , have you had any hearing problem at all ? Um , I had something maybe about a year ago , but it only lasted a couple of days . It wasn't anything as long as this . Right . Okay . Okay . And , um , in this six week period , have you had anything else happen ? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all ? Um , I occasionally get , like , a ringing in my left ear , uh , just on the one side . And , um , there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well . Right . Okay . And just to clarify , the difficulty you've got in hearing is that both ears or just the left ear ? Just the left ear . Yeah . All right . So your right ear is fine . It seems to be . Yeah . Okay . So you've had ringing difficulty hearing in your left ear and feeling slightly sick . And that's been on and off for the six weeks . Or is it continuous throughout that six weeks ? Uh , it's kind of on and off , like some things trigger it as well . So , for example , if I'm watching TV or listening to music or something , that'll set off the ringing in the ear . Right . Okay . Um , and , um , have you had any pain from the ear at all ? Uh , no . Okay . Any discharge coming out of the ear ? No . Okay . Um , have have you been experiencing any fever ? Uh , not specifically apart from the dizziness and sickness I mentioned . Right . Okay . And , um , has your ear been itchy at all ? No . Okay . Now , do you use cotton wool buds to try and clean out wax from your ears . Uh , no . I don't know , okay . Well , you're right , you should . We shouldn't be doing that . It doesn't clean up the wax . It pushes it back in . All right , um , the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear . Okay . And just exclude the simple things . Simple things might be wax . You know , someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube going into the eardrum , which can lead to muffled hearing . Um , if that's the case , that's something that's easily fixable . But , um , so we need to exclude that first . And then after that , we can consider other potential possibilities . Um , and for that , we need to have a look inside the eardrum . So , um , what I think we could do is , um , maybe if we book you in for a face to face appointment in one of our clinics . It's not an emergency . It can be done within the next 4 or 5 days or so . Okay . And then , um , what I'll do is I'll send a message to our admin team . I'll ask them to slot you in in the clinic , one of our clinics . In that time frame , you can come in and one of the GPS will just have a quick look down the ear and figure out whether there's a physical blockage or whether there's something else going on . Okay . Okay . Um , can I just double check the dizziness that you've been getting ? How severe is it ? Uh , it's nothing major . It's just kind of , uh . It's like the kind of dizziness you get with nausea , like , uh , not not proper room spinning or anything like that , but just just a little bit , kind of off balance and . Right , right . Okay . Have you had any chest pain with it ? No . No palpitations . Heart beating fast . Okay , fine . All right . Um , so let's get your ear checked out . I think that would be the most sensible thing to do . And then after that , we can we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we're going to go . It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear , but we just need to exclude whether there's a physical blockage first and try and deal with that if that's the case . Okay . Um , is that sort of thing that can cause , uh , like this ringing in my ear because it seems like the ringing that you've got , that you've got something called tinnitus . Okay . Um , and tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors . We don't really understand it fully . We haven't , you know , people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinnitus and some patients don't . It can be triggered by a wide range of different things . And in fact , I'm glad that you mentioned that . What I might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment , I'm going to put . Paste the link for a leaflet about tinnitus , um , in the notes for this appointment . I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it . Okay . And often that that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are and there are limited options , um , that helps us in terms of the conversation about what we do next . If your ear is clear . Okay . So I'm going to paste a link to that . Um , and you can read about that . And what we'll do is we'll see you in about 4 or 5 days time . It won't be with me , it'll be another GP , but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is , which is just to check your ears . Is that okay ? Yeah . Sounds great . All right . Great . So , um , bear with me five minutes , and then you can ring the support team . I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment . Ring them , and then they'll slot you in . Okay ? Okay . Brilliant . All right . If there's any problem , any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is , just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video . Okay . Okay . All right then . Take care . Nice to see you this morning . Thank you . Okay . Bye bye .
