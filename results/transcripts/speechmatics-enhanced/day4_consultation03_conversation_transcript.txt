Hi . Hi . Can you hear me ? Yeah , I can hear you . Good . Um , my name is Doctor Goel . I'm one of the physicians that works here at Babylon . Okay . Can I confirm your name and date of birth , please ? Uh . Uh , my name is Sarah Smith , and my date of birth is the 20th of the fourth , 1983 , 1983 . And are you in a space that's private and quiet and you can talk ? Yeah . Good . So it says , um , I've got a note to say . It says you're feeling short of breath . Is that correct ? Yeah . Okay . Are you able to tell me a little bit more about that ? Yeah , I was watching TV and , um , just like over the last hour , I've started to feel like , a bit short of breath . And this is while you're sitting watching TV . Yeah . Okay . And have you noticed anything like this before ? Um , no . Okay . And apart from the shortness of breath , have you noticed anything else ? Um . So I started with a cough yesterday . Okay . Um , yeah . I don't know if it's , um , relevant , but I had a C-section a few weeks ago . Okay . And how long ago was that ? Just a few weeks . Yeah . Four weeks . Okay . And are you with baby at the moment ? Yes , I am . And how is baby doing ? Yeah . He's good . Okay . Any coughs or colds with them ? No , no . He's fine . Okay . So you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting watching TV . And you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago ? Yes . And yesterday you noticed a cough . Yeah . So talk to me about the cough . Have you brought anything up ? Uh , no I haven't . No . And when was the last time you were ill with a flu or symptoms like this ? Um , you know , I get coughs and colds quite a lot , but probably a good few months ago . Okay . And this shortness of breath you're having , is it getting worse ? Um , no , I mean , I don't know . I feel like I'm getting really stressed out because , like , my heart is really going . Okay , so you're feeling your heart more than normal . Yeah . And the shortness of breath . Does it cause any pain in your chest ? Um , no . How about when you take a very deep breath in ? Um , I mean , yeah , my chest feels sore , but so does my C-section scar . You know , it's all tender . Okay . And since your C-section , did you have to take any medications ? Um , no . Just some painkillers . And can you remember what the name of those were ? Uh , they gave me some , uh , codeine . And have you had to use that regularly ? Uh , yeah , I've been taking that fairly fairly regularly , but probably haven't taken it for a week . Okay . And apart from the C-section and the shortness of breath , have you got any other medical problems I should know about ? Um , no . And are you allergic ? I tell you , I'm allergic to ibuprofen , though . Okay . And what happens when you take ibuprofen ? Um , I don't know . So I need you to do something for me . Have you measured the rate of your heart before ? Uh , yes . Have you measured it recently ? Either with an iWatch or something similar ? No I haven't . No . Okay . We might need to do that over the phone . So are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb and see if you can feel your heartbeat ? Yep . So I want you to do is when I count to three , count down from three . Just count the number of beats you've noticed and I'll tell you when to stop . Is that okay ? Yep . So we'll start in three , two , one . Go . Great . That should be enough . How many did you count ? Uh , I counted 30 . Good . So your heart is running slightly fast at the moment , which is probably because of your shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under . Okay . Given that you've had a C-section and you're short of breath , which has come on quite recently and quite quickly , it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out a bit further . Okay , so there's two ways of us doing this . The first is I can call an ambulance , or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby . Which one would you prefer ? Uh , it feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance . Um . I'll go , I'll take myself . Sure . And what I would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time . Okay . And if you're taking any medications like codeine , don't don't take them for the time being . Okay . Is anyone else with you at home ? Uh , no . My partner's at work . Okay . So I think that's the best thing to do for the time being . Mhm . So what I'm worried about at the moment is given that you've had a C-section , some people can suffer with clots and those can either be found in the legs or your chest . So in your lungs . Yeah . It's quite a common thing to happen . And it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first . Okay . And if it if that does become the case , they can give you something to reduce the clot . All right . Okay . That's a fairly quick process . Okay . Yeah I mean , my mum's had clots in her legs before , so I guess , you know . Yeah , that makes sense . I know what they are . Good . Are you are you particularly worried about anything , or do you want to ask me anything before we go ? No , no . I'm fine . I'll . I'll just take myself to the hospital . Great . Thank you so much . All right . Thank you .
