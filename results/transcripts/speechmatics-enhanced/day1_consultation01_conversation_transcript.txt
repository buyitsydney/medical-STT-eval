Do you mean you've been having . Have you been feeling feverish , for example ? Um . Yeah . It doesn't feel like . Yeah . I just make me feel weak . I haven't had a fever , um , at the moment , but I did notice , um , a temperature when the symptoms started , so , um . Yeah , around about 3 or 4 days ago . Do you measure your temperature then ? Yeah . I didn't measure my temperature . No , but I felt , um , just a bit hot . Okay , okay . Any other symptoms ? Like sweating or , um , no , no . And , uh , any vomiting at all ? Yeah . So , um , I vomited at the start of the symptoms , but now , um , I've stopped vomiting . Stop vomiting . Okay . And was your vomit ? I know it's not nice to talk about , but was it just normal food colour ? Yeah , yeah , just normal vomit . Yeah . There was no blood in your vomit . Is that right ? No blood ? No , no . Okay . Um . And , um , any other symptoms at all ? You mentioned the tummy pain . You mentioned diarrhoea . You mentioned vomiting . Yeah . Anything else that comes to mind ? Um , I had a loss of appetite . Um , I haven't been eating as much . Um , but I've been able to hold down fluids . Okay . So you're drinking fluids ? Yeah . What kind of foods have you managed to eat ? Anything . Um , just soups and , um . Yeah . Light foods , like smoothies and . Yeah , liquid foods mainly . Okay , fine . Um . And so you started three days ago . Symptoms . Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms to kick on . So for example , things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms . Yeah . So I had takeaway about four days ago . Um , um , but other than that , I've . Yeah . Been , uh , eating normally . Nothing unusual . Yeah . Do you remember where you ate ? Um . Yeah , I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends . Okay . Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms ? Um , so no one else in the family . So I have a wife and two kids , and one , um , child was vomiting , but they haven't got diarrhoea . There's no one with the same symptoms . Okay . Okay , fine . Um , right . And , uh , in terms of your your overall health , are you normally fit and well or . Um , yeah . I mean , other than , um , asthma ? Um , I use an inhaler . Everything else is fine . Okay . And is your asthma well controlled ? Uh , yeah . That's fine . Uh , just . Yeah . Use an inhaler and , uh , that's under control . Fine . And you don't have any other tummy problem . Bowel problems I should be aware of . No , no . Okay . Um , and apart from the inhalers , do you take any other medications ? Uh , no . No other medications . Okay , fine . And in terms of just your your day to day life , you said it's been affecting your life . Um , yeah . In what way has it been affecting your life ? Uh , sorry . I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during the these past three days . Okay . Um , yeah . Other than that , it's , uh . Yeah , the main concern . And have you . Are you currently working at the moment ? Uh , yeah , I work , um . Work ? Um , I'm an accountant . Okay . Have you been going into work the last three days , or have you been at home ? Uh , yeah , I've been going to work . Okay . That must be difficult for you , then . Yeah , it's been quite difficult . And you said you mentioned you live with a wife and two children . Is that right ? Yes . Yeah . All right . Um , just a couple of other questions we need to ask . Um , do you smoke at all ? Uh , no , I don't smoke . And do you drink much in the way of alcohol ? Uh , no , I don't drink alcohol . No . Okay . So , um , uh , Normally at this stage . I'd like to examine you first . Okay . But , um . Um , but having listened to your story , I think , um , just to recap , for the last three days , you've been having loose stool diarrhea , a bit of tummy pain , mainly on the left hand side , um , and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic . Um , you mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago , and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems . Okay . Um , it seems like you may have something , uh , called gastroenteritis . Okay . Which is essentially just a tummy bug or an infection of your of your tummy . Um , mainly caused by viruses , but it can be a possibility of bacteria are causing your symptoms . Yeah . Um , at this stage , uh , what what we'd recommend is just what we say , conservative management . So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics is really just making sure you're well hydrated . So drinking plenty of fluids . Um , uh , there are things like dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy , which it's , um , it helps to replenish some of your minerals and vitamins . Okay . And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea , I would certainly recommend that first , you know , first couple of days . Yeah . If you are feeling feverish and weak taking some paracetamol , uh , two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help . I would certainly advise you to take some time off work , as I know you're quite keen to work . Um , I would say next to 2 to 3 days . Um , as protection clears from your system , just take some time off and rest . Um , and , you know , if your symptoms haven't got better , you know , in 3 to 4 days , I'd like to come back and see you again , okay ? Because if it is ongoing , then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing the symptoms . Yeah , and we may need to do further tests , like , um , taking a sample of your stool so we can test that , um , etcetera , etcetera . Yeah , sure . Yeah . How's that sound ? That sounds great . Yeah . Yeah . Do you have any questions for me ? Um , no . No further questions ? No . Okay . Is the treatment plan clear ? Uh , yeah . Yeah , that's that's very clear . Thank you . Great . Well , I wish you all the best . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . Bye . Bye bye .
