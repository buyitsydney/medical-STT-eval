Thanks to . Hello . Hi . Can you hear me ? Okay . Yeah , I can hear you . Right . Excellent . Before I go any further , can I confirm your name and your age , please ? Sure . Um , I'm Amanda Jackson , and I'm 19 years old . 19 years old . Okay , Amanda . And how can I help you this afternoon ? Um , so it's been going on for a few days now . Um , it's not happened before , and I'm a bit worried . It hurts when I pee . Um . And . Yeah , it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more . Um , and it's really like , I can't , like , go to uni properly . I'm just , like , constantly looking for the toilet . Um , and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like , at the bottom of my tummy as well . Right . Okay . I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you . Um , so you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days , mainly the burning pain when you pass urine . Um , you said you go to the toilet more often as well . Is that right ? Uh , yeah . It's been going on for a little bit longer than three days , I think . Actually , maybe just under a week . Oh , on the week . Sorry . Um , okay . Sorry . No , I didn't explain it properly before . Um , yeah . No , I it's been going on for about just under a week . Um , and yeah , I do notice sort of burning , stinging when I , when I go to the toilet . Yeah . Have you noticed any , any anything in your urine , any blood or , um , discolouration of urine ? Um , I think well , today I noticed , um , it was like a bit pink . The the urine . Yeah . I think just today , any kind of frank blood . I mean , red blood at all in your urine . Um , I think it was probably , I don't know , it was pink , so . Okay . Um , fine . We'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on . Um , you also mentioned some tummy pain as well . Can you tell me a bit more about that pain ? Yeah , it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy . Um , mainly when I go to the loo . I think that's when it's worse . Okay . Um , can you describe a crampy pain ? Is it more of a burning pain ? Um , I wouldn't describe it as crampy . I don't think it's like a period pain . It's a bit different . It's . It's hard to say . An achy pain , I suppose . Achy pain . Okay . Does the pain move anywhere else ? Does it move towards your back ? Towards your sides ? No no , no . Okay . All right . Um , any other symptoms at all ? Nausea . Vomiting ? No . No . Nausea . Vomiting . Okay . Any temperatures or fevers ? Um , no . No , not that I've noticed . Okay . All right . And how are your bowels at the moment ? Your bowels working ? Okay . Uh , I , I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway , so I don't think it's any different . Okay . And what it usually is when you have problems , what kind of problems do you normally have ? Um , I think I have , um , IBS , um , so I just kind of pass my battles , like , quite , quite a lot . Um , and sometimes it's quite , it's quite variable . Like , sometimes it's a bit softer , sometimes it's a bit it's sorry , it's a bit disgusting , but like , sometimes it's a bit better and it's kind of hard to predict . Okay . All right . But no no no no no new symptoms in your bowels . No , no not okay . All right . Um , and , Amanda , sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions , as you can imagine . Um , uh , can I ask , are you currently , uh , are you currently sexually active ? Uh , yeah . Uh , yeah . Um , I have , uh , a long term , um , boyfriend . Okay . And , um , have you noticed any other discharge from down below ? So from the front passage . Um , not . No , I don't think so . Nothing unusual . Okay . Have you do you use any form of contraception ? Uh , yeah . Uh , I'm , on the pill . The pill ? What kind of pill is it ? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill ? Combined pill ? Okay , fine . Um , when was the last time you had , um , unprotected sex ? Um . Uh , I mean , I mean , unprotected . Is it , like , no . No condoms or anything ? Yeah , exactly . Um , I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend , just , like , I don't know , we've just kind of agreed . Uh , so , uh , I guess a week ago . Two weeks ago . Okay . All right . I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether , um , there's any chance you could be pregnant at all . I know you're on the pill , but we nonetheless , we do have to ask , um , when was your last ? When was your last period ? Um , two weeks ago . Two weeks ago . Okay . All right . Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better . Okay . Um , fine . In terms of your general health . Otherwise , at the moment , are you , uh , eating and drinking . Okay . Uh , yeah . Yeah . Eating . Drinking . Okay . Um , I did have one kind of concern , I don't know . So I smoked , uh , this is quite bad , but I smoked weed for the first time , uh , like , a week and a half ago . And I just wonder whether it's related at all . Probably not , but I just thought I'd get some advice from you . Sure . Well , thanks for sharing with me . Um , so I don't think this is related to your symptoms . I think it's probably just a pure coincidence . Um , but , uh , you know , I do strongly advise you to . You know , um , make it a regular habit if you can , um , just just for your general health moving forward . Okay . Um , fine . Moving on . In terms of your health . Otherwise , do you have any other medical conditions apart from IBS ? Is there anything else I should be aware of ? No , no . Okay , great . And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the , um , combined pill ? Apart from the pill , Um , I take , um , something for the IBS as well . Um , it begins with an M . It's really hard to pronounce . Like maybe something . Maybe . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , yeah . That's it . Yeah , yeah . That's right . Okay . And that for the cramps . The crampy pain . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And do you have any allergies to any medications ? Um , yeah . I think there was an antibiotic , um , called clindesse clindamycin . Okay . That I took like a couple of years ago or something . And . Yeah , that that didn't go too well right with me . Okay . Sure . I'll make a note of that . Um , in terms of family history , any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys ? Nope , nope . Anything else ? Good . And socially , tell me a bit more about your home situation . Who's at home with you ? Um , so I am living in halls at the moment , uh , at uni . Um , so , uh , I'm just living with a flatmate , I suppose . Um , but my family live kind of outside of London , not too far away . Um , so yeah , my family are fine , and I see them now and then . Very good . Yeah , I think I think they're generally great . And what are you studying at university ? Um . Studying English . English . Okay , good . And how are you enjoying your course ? Yeah , yeah , it's going well . Thanks . Just kind of started , uh , a few months ago . A few months ago . Yeah . I really enjoy it . Yeah . Good , good . Um , in terms of smoking and alcohol , do you do you participate in either ? Uh , as I admitted before , I tried with the first time . Uh , but I don't smoke . Uh , I drink occasionally , um , kind of socially with friends . Okay . What made you have your first joint last week ? Um , I was just a party . Um , there was a lot of people doing it . Um , I kind of was a little bit tipsy , so probably wasn't thinking quite straight . Um , but , yeah , I completely agree . It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis . Sure . And obviously , as your doctor , I'm here to look after you . So I would strongly recommend you , you know , to avoid it . Great . Um , fine . So at this stage , I would normally examine you , but I think based on your story , I think , um , you know , I'm reassured by the fact . I think it's , um , probably just a simple what we say UTI or a cystitis bladder infection . Um , you know , you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about . So things like fevers and back pain , um , would be more worrying for me to hear . Um , so something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics . Um , so we've got a choice of two antibiotics , something called trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin , which is a three day course . Normally , they're usually quite effective . Um , for your symptoms , it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well , if you can . So we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there . Um , start the antibiotics , make sure you're well hydrated , drink plenty of fluids . Um , yeah . If you are having some pain , simple paracetamol , um , would probably be advisable . Um , we'll see what the urine sample shows . Um , and if it is indeed positive , we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones . Um , but if things are still not getting any better next week , come back and see me and we can have another look again , okay ? Okay , great . Um , with with the urine sample . Um , how do I go about doing that ? So through the app ? No . Uh , well good question . So I will give you I will organise , uh , for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices , which we can test there and then with a urine dip and send it off to the lab . We can always get back in touch with you with the results . Okay . Perfect . Okay , great . Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting . If you have any of those , give me a call . Okay . Fever . Back pain , vomiting . Yeah . Okay . Have a good day . Okay . Thank you , thank you . You too . Bye bye .
