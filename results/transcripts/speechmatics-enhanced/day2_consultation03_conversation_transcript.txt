So , like , my jawline just all feeling a bit numb around here . Right . Okay . Okay . Um , has anything else happened , um , in this time ? Any other symptoms you had at all ? Not that I noticed . I think occasionally noticed . Ringing in my ear . Um , ringing in your ear . Okay . Yeah , sure . Okay . Um . And , um , have you had any weakness or numbness down the . In the rest of the body at all ? No no no , no , nothing like that . Okay . Have you had any difficulty swallowing ? No . And have you had any difficulties speaking ? No . Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all ? No . That's all good . Okay . And do you have the numbness present right now ? Uh , yeah , it's kind of kind of there quite often . Like all the time . So yeah , right now it feels very . Doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face . Sure , sure . Okay . All right . Um , just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear . Um , do you have any discharge coming from that area at all ? No , nothing . Nothing coming out . Any pain in there or from the ear ? Uh , no . Right . Okay . And , um , have you had any fever at all ? No , nothing like that . And do you , um , have any itchiness in the ear ? Do you use cotton wool buds to kind of clean your ears out ? I don't . Oh , no . No , no . Okay . All right . Um , do you need to ask a few other general questions ? Um , do you have any other illnesses at all ? Um , I well , I've got kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of heartburn feeling , um , but that's all fine . And you know , I take a rennies if I need to . And if my polyps are playing up , I've got a spray . Um , other than that , I think they said ages ago I had something called . I can't quite remember , but labyrinthitis something like that . But again , nothing . Nothing on . Sure . Okay . So are you on any regular medication ? You mentioned the spray for your nose ? Yes . No , I only take the spray my nose when I need it for , and , um , sometimes take , like , rennies . But I just get that from the chemist . Sure . And the spray for your nose . Where do you get that from ? Is that from a doctor ? Uh , yeah . They gave me a prescription ages ago . Yeah . Do you remember the name of the spray tool ? Unfortunately I don't . Sorry . That's alright . That's good . And you're not on any other medication at all ? No . No . Okay . Do you have any allergies to any medication ? Uh , no . Just latex . LaTeX . Okay . All right . That's good to know . Um , and , um , in terms of your family , are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all ? My brother has neurofibromatosis . I think it is . Right . Other than that , everyone else is okay . Okay , good . That's good to hear . Um , and in terms of your own kind of background now , are you are you working at the moment ? Yeah . So I'm a , I'm a jockey . Um , but because of all the kind of symptoms I've been getting , especially sometimes when I get a ringing , I can feel a bit dizzy . Um , I've just had to do far less training . So . Kind of beginning to . Yeah , it's impacting work . Um , a little bit now . Okay , so you have to excuse my jockey , like with horses . Is that what you're talking about ? Yeah . All right . Okay , fine . Um , great . Um . And , uh , do you live alone ? Um . I , uh , live with my partner . Okay . Right . Um , do you have any pets at all at home ? No . No pets . Okay , fine . Fantastic . All right . Um , is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently ? Um , no . Just like . Like I said , like the ringing , um , occasionally . And when I get back , I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy . But the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me , like , yeah , no idea what's going on there . Okay , fine . All right . Um , so I think . Go on . I was just like , there was one thing I think just because I can panic and you can look online , get a bit frantic , I guess what I'm trying to think is , you know , is there something particularly serious that , you know , will need to be sorted ? And obviously , really , anything can make you really frantic ? Is it hopefully nothing so serious . I would die from it . I don't know , I just , I think , um , uh , obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video , uh , portal . But , um , from what you've told me , this doesn't seem to be anything , um , that you're going to die from . However , I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today . Okay ? I would like you to come into one of my clinics . I'd like a GP to assess you . This . What you're describing might be something called Bell's palsy . Okay , um , we can go into that explaining what that is . If , um , if that's confirmed on physical examination . Um , that's not usually a life threatening problem , but part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can just do a what we call a neurological examination , just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis . Have a look . Have a look inside the ear . See if there's any anything to see within the ear . So , um , so in answer to your question , no , I don't think that you need to worry about that . I think , you know , preliminarily , I can I can reassure you . However , do you know , in order to definitively reassure you , I think you need a physical examination today . Okay . So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team . I'll ask them to book you in for a face to face appointment in one of our clinics , um , within central London . Okay . And then you can ring the the support team number . I'll leave that number in your notes . You can read them after five minutes , and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you . Okay . That's fine . All right , so someone will see you , and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further . But please make sure the appointment gets done today , okay ? Yep . No will do . That's fine . Thank you very much . All right then . Okay . Nice to see you . Take care . Bye bye . Bye .
