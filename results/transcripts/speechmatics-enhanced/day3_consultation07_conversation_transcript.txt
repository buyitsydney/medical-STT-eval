So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema . So what do you do about it . How do you keep it under control . Yeah . Usually I use a cream called diprobase . Uh , yeah . In the shower I use something called dermal . Dermal . All right . And have you been using them recently or not ? Yes , yes , I use them . Use them every day . Yes , I . There's no change in that . I didn't change any . Okay . Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema ? Um . I , I I'm not sure . Uh . Ah , yes . Yes , yes . You've used it . Um . But it's not helping . Yeah . Oh , so you're still using the steroids ? Yeah , I tried , I tried . Which one are you using ? The steroids . What's the name ? I'm not sure . It's , uh . Is it the . It's not there . Okay . So is it like the over-the-counter ones ? Sorry . Over-the-counter hydrocortisone . Does that ring a bell ? Yeah . So you're using the hydrocortisone ? Yeah . Are you using any antihistamines at all ? Uh , no . No . No . Antihistamines . Okay . Right . Fine . Otherwise , other than the rash , you're feeling well in yourself . There's no temperature , no joint pains . Yeah . No joint pains ? No , but I've tried those antihistamine , and it didn't work . You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work . Okay , which one did you try ? The one over the counter . Okay . So like cetirizine ? Yeah . Yeah , okay . That's fine . Right . Okay . So from what you're describing , it looks like , you know , it is quite widespread . Your eczema . Yeah . Because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that . Um , so do you have any allergies to any medication at all ? No . No allergies ? No allergies . Okay . And you don't . Other than eczema , you don't have any other medical condition .

Um , uh , you know , probably inhaler . The inhaler . So you don't you don't use it every day , so you just use it on and off . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Blue inhalers , but your breathing's all okay . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , yeah . Only it's only when I have a flare . Sure . So what we need to do is obviously you've got extent , as I've mentioned . So extensive eczema . What we'll do is need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable we'll you would probably need some antihistamines which I'm going to prescribe also . Hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children . You might probably need a bit more stronger one like Betnovate or something like that . Okay . So we'll try that first . So I'm going to it's called the antihistamine called fexofenadine . And then we will try with some betnovate first . So it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip . Yeah . This much is , is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands . Yeah . So it's very small amount so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the amount . The whole body . Yeah . So use that . You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks . Okay . Okay . If if there's no improvement , you need to get back to us . Or if you have any kind of adverse reaction , like an allergic reaction , which is unlikely , but if it still happens , you need to get in touch with us . Okay . Okay . Thank you very much . So what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy . It looks like boots on the systems . Is that correct ? Yeah . Yes . Yes . So I'll send it across to boots and it will be there for collecting . If things are getting worse in the next two weeks , call us beforehand . Otherwise , wait for two weeks . Take the medication and the cream . You still need to continue on your emollients like the dermol soap and as well as the diprovate . Yeah , so you still need to use those in the interim . Any questions at all ? No . No questions . Thank you . Thank you . You take care then . Bye bye now . Thank you . Bye bye .
