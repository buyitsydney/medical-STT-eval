So , just before we start , is it all right ? If you could confirm your full name for me , please ? Yes . Maria Trabelsi . Okay . And your date of birth . That is the 1st of October , 1999 . Okay . And your email address for me , please ? Yes . m@gmail.com . Okay . And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we have a confidential conversation . Yes , I think I am . Yeah . Good . Right . You've mentioned in your , in , in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and after you had a sandwich , Is that correct ? Yeah . That is . Well , I don't think . I don't think it was it wasn't a sandwich , but it was , it was something with prawns . So basically I , I sometimes go with my friends to , to this place called Fat Fuck . And we , we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something and . Yeah . And then I wanted to try something new . Um , so what happened was I , I ordered a prawn soup . It's called a lox . It's like soup . I ordered prawn one this time . Yeah . And . Yeah . And then my . I feel like my lips started feeling a little weird just in the corner , sort of on the left first and then I don't know . And then we went back . We had a little bit of a chat of banter . I wasn't really paying attention . Um , now I feel that that there is a swelling . Yes , there is a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger . I don't know what to do . All right . So when did you have the prawn soup ? What time that was . That must have been just after work . So maybe like around seven . Okay . Around 7:00 . And , um , how long did it take to develop the swelling ? Well , I wasn't really paying attention , so it must have been , like . Must have been like . And a half an hour , maybe . Okay . In half an hour , you develop the swelling ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And it's getting bigger and bigger . Yeah . It's still feel it , like , really pumping blood . And it's kind of getting bigger . It feels like it's getting worse . Okay , so just a few more questions . Um , so you mentioned about your swelling of your lips . Is there any feeling of swelling in your throat , like your throat is closing up . Any feeling like that ? Yeah , actually , I feel like I can't breathe that well right now . Okay . And do you feel like . Like your chest is tight ? I don't know if the chest just generally feels a little difficult . Okay . Yeah , it might be . I'm not sure . Okay . Right . And just a few . Have you ever had these ? Any kind of lip swelling in the past after eating any food ? Yeah . Well , maybe . I remember , like , a year ago . A year ago , I was out with my friends , and I think we went , like , to a late night kind of Chinese place . And I remember that I was quite drunk , to be honest . And I remember that after like having that very late . I woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like felt really bad and quite difficult breathing . But I didn't know what it was I had . It was like a curry or something . Okay . Uh , and what did you take at that time ? Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time ? Well , I generally have asthma , so I , I take , uh , what's it called ? Salbutamol inhalers . Yeah . Yeah . So I do take that regularly , but I've always taken it . I generally have asthma and any other inhalers . Is it just the salbutamol that you use . Any other brown inhalers . Oh no . No , I don't think so . No . Okay . Right . And , um , so do you use antihistamines like cetirizine , loratadine , piriton , any of those kind of things ? No , no , I do sometimes , but I don't know which ones . So I have a peanut allergy as well . Yeah . Like I always had it . Yeah . And I think I do get antihistamines for that but I'm not sure which ones . And any point because you had peanut allergy any time you had to ever use like an injection . When I was a kid , I think I remember my mom told me about it , but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors since . Right . Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction ? Yeah , well , I was like six or something . I , I , I think , oh , sorry . The swelling is getting . Oh , yeah . I think when I was . Right . Are you okay now . Are busy right now . To be honest , you feel dizzy . Okay . Right . Do you have any kind of , uh , Antihistamines with you at the moment ? No , I don't think I have . Oh , right . Okay . So . Right . All right . I'm really worried about you at the moment , Maria . Um , I think we need to call an ambulance because , um . From what history you've been telling me , it sounds like you could be going into what we say . An anaphylactic reaction . That's when your throat and your chest closes in , and you might need an injection . Like what ? Your mum's , um . You know what your mum told you as you were a young child ? Okay . Right . So is there anyone with you at the moment or are you alone ? I'm alone at the moment . Okay , so hang on the line while I call the ambulance . Okay . And I'll send them right to you . Okay . And somebody just came ? Yes . I'm not alone anymore . Oh , right . Okay . Somebody just came . So just call the ambulance . Make sure that person is with you till the ambulance comes . Yeah . Um , and because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction . So you need to go straight away . Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we are waiting ? Yes . Uh , mom . Mom . Do we have any antihistamines around ? Yes . Yes . Yeah , we do that straight away . And if mom can call mom , if you can call the , uh , 99999 . Yeah . And say that there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away . Okay . Yes . She says she will . Yes . Yes . So straight away . Take the antihistamines in the meantime . All right . Okay . Okay . Thank you . Come up from the hospital . Do you give us a ring back ? We might need to sort you out . Um , with your injections and things like that . Okay . Yes , yes . I'll do . Yes . Thank you . Okay , then . Take care . Thank you very much . Bye bye . Bye bye .
