Do you have any idea the headache is going to come ? Uh , not really , but generally during work times . So it's normally at work , I'm at work . I'm in a meeting or on my laptop . Okay .

No , it's mostly in the front . And then . Yeah , it kind of stays there . And when you have the headache specifically , do you feel sick ? Not . Not really , but it's like making it hard . Yeah , I kind of feel a little bit nauseous , maybe . Okay . And sometimes I also feel like , um . Yeah , it's like , uh , maybe , probably breathing or something . Okay . Yeah . And do you normally get headaches before all of this started ? Uh , so , no , I feel like my , like , health situation was mostly under control . Okay . Yeah . And then it started roughly when I changed jobs . Okay , so talk to me about your job . What do you do ? I'm a lawyer . And do you work in London at the moment ? Yes . So , do you get these headaches on your commute into work ? Um . Not really . I get it mostly when I'm at work . Okay . And tell me about what you do .

And these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer . Um . Yeah . It happens then . Yeah . Okay . And tell me , what did you do before being a lawyer ? Uh , no , I was a lawyer at a previous job as well . Okay . So talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment . If , uh , ten out of ten is extremely stressful and one out of ten is being on vacation . Where at the moment . I think it's 7 or 8 . And is that normal for you ? Yeah . It's like a law firm . Like there's always pressure . Okay , so you mentioned your headaches . You also mentioned your reduced appetite . So you don't want to eat as much . Yeah . Have you lost weight ? Yes . Can you remember how much you've lost ? £5 . And is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional ? It's not intentional , no .

And do you get that in your legs as well ? No . And what does it feel like ? The tingling . Prickling . Yeah . And again , is this the first time you've noticed this ? Yeah . Okay .

Uh , but like I would say , like , I get this , like , feeling of , like , short of breath . Okay . Sometimes . So , like , that could be what you were referring to . Yes . So do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk ? Yeah . No . Yes . Sorry . Yes . Okay . And how about when you're exercising . No . Okay . And the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heart beating . Yeah . Again . How often do you get that . I when I like , it's maybe once a day . Um , maybe more . Um . There's one more thing that I think I should mention . Like I do have , like some loss of libido at home . Okay . How long has that been happening for ? Same amount of time . Really ? Like , since I changed my job . Fine . And apart from all of these things that you've told me , do you have any other medical problems ? Uh , well , I have hypothyroidism . Okay . And do you take medications for that ? Thyroxine . And are you remembering to take your medications ? Yes . Okay . And do you drink or smoke ? Yes . How much do you drink ? Like once a week .

Okay , so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana ? know . Okay . Thank you . And are you allergic to anything ? No . Good . So you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment , and I can understand . They probably feel quite strange and unusual . Yeah . Um , I think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic . Yeah , we can give you an examination . And what that means is we check your heart and your breathing . Yeah . To make sure that those things are functioning correctly . Yeah . And probably do some blood tests for your thyroxin . Yeah . And take it from there . How does that sound ? That sounds very good . Thank you . I think before we give you any medications , we should see you in person . Okay . So what I'm going to do is book an appointment , or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see us in the clinic and see one of my colleagues . Yeah . I'll let them know what you've told me today , so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said . Thank you . Great . Do you have any questions ? No , that was it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Bye .
