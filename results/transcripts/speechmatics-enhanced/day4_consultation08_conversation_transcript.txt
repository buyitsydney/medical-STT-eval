Sorry . Hello ? Are you there ? Hi . Hi , there . Uh , my name's Joe . I'm one of the doctors at Babylon . I just can I confirm your name , please ? Hi . Yeah , my name is , uh . So sorry . Your name was . Name was Brian . Brian . Hi , Brian . Nice to , um . Uh . And your date of birth ? Yeah , my date of birth is the 8th of August , 1982 . Great . And , uh , are you in a sort of , uh , confidential place where you can speak freely ? Yeah . No . No one else can hear me . Great . And you're happy to continue with the consultation ? Yes . Marvellous . Okay , so , um , how can I help today ? Yeah . Um , so basically , it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so , but I don't really feel like , um , like getting up in the morning is really difficult , and I don't have much energy at all during the day . Um , often . Yeah . Just like doing most things that I would normally find easy . Uh , it's become quite difficult . Okay , so things have become quite difficult for you . Yeah . Is there anything else ? Um . Oh , it's quite hard to say . Like things like I'm not not eating very much at the moment . I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy . Okay . I'm sorry to hear that . Um , so you've had difficulty waking up ? No energy , not eating . And that's been going on for a few weeks . When you say a few weeks , do you mean two or 3 or 5 ? How roughly how ? I kind of think about it . Maybe . Maybe even longer . Um , I guess it might be related to . So I also started a new job slightly recently . Um , it might have even coincided coincided with , uh , with that job a couple of months ago . When did you start your new job ? Two months ago . Did you say . Yeah . Okay . And , um , so this has been going on perhaps for , um , sort of six weeks or so . More like two months , I would say . Yeah . Okay . All right . So , um . Is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about , um , or hoping to get out of this consultation ? Well , um , I know that it's not really normal for me . So before this phase started happening , you know , I wouldn't have , uh , any problems sort of eating what I want to eat or , you know , doing standard things in life . And what I want to do is to , like , kind of return to that previous state . Uh , somehow , um , I'm not sure how that is , uh , what the best ways of doing that are , but , yeah , give some advice or whatever . That'd be really useful . Okay . Sure . Okay . Um , well , what would I like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on . Um , and also around your background , health and , um , and things like that . And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there . Is that right ? Okay . Okay . Great . So you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy , difficult waking up in the mornings . Do you tend to just on that note , do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the mornings ? Um , actually , I'm just , uh , not not really waking up early . It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all . Probably . I think that's probably close . Difficulty sleeping as well . Yeah . And have you . And how has your mood been over this period ? Have you been , um , feeling distracted ? I'd say , uh , I kind of , um . Yeah . Finding it really hard to . Quite difficult to keep focusing , I would say , um , not unhappy or happy , but just , uh , quite just not focused . Okay . So difficulty focusing , quite distracted . And would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low ? Um , actually , uh , now you mention it like my mood is a bit lower recently . Um , and so I've noticed , like , uh , my sex drive has kind of decreased , um , a bit over the past few months as well , so . Yeah . Okay . And , uh , so lower mood decreased sex drive recently as well . And just on that note , just a few questions around that . Are you able to maybe slightly personal questions . But if you're okay to answer these , do you tend to to have morning erections like you . Is that something that you've noticed ? I haven't noticed anything like that specifically . No . So you've so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections and usually you would . It's normal thing to have , uh , waking up in the morning with something . But you have not noticed those recently . I have not noticed those recently . Okay . So . And that's been a change . Is it ? Um . Important one , I don't think . Um . Sorry . Yeah . I don't think it's an important change now . Uh , so you don't think there's been a change there ? No , there hasn't been a change to that . Okay . Sorry . Right . Sorry . Okay . So , um , just going back to the mood symptoms as well . Uh , you've had , uh , difficulty focusing . Easily distracted . Your mood has been , uh , slightly lower with lower sex drive . Yeah . Um , and in what way has your sex drive been lower ? Uh , are you in a relationship at the moment ? Yeah . I'm married . Um , I've been for many years , and . Yeah , just , um , over the last few months , just , uh , been disinterested . Disinterested . Present . Okay . So are you phrase there for a moment ? Um , so less interested as well . Okay . And just to ask you a few questions before we wrap up , is , uh , any significant past medical history ? Um , so do you suffer from any , uh , Mental health problems in the past or any physical health problems . Um , so in the past , um , I have a history of hypothyroidism . Roidism . Um . Hypo hypothyroidism . Hypothyroidism ? Yeah . So , um , my thyroid , just to sort of confirm that . Sorry . Can you say that again , please ? Hyper as in high hyper thyroid . Hypo hypo hypo thyroid . Thank you . Thank you . Um , yeah . And , uh , also in the past , I mean , I haven't had any kind of specific , uh , medical diagnoses along these lines . Um , but there is suspicion that it may have had an impact on me , but my father has committed suicide , um , about 15 years ago . Okay . Okay . And , um . Uh , do you take any medications ? I have a drug history of thyroxine . So maybe . Yes . Do you continue to take thyroxine now ? Yes . You do . So you're taking thyroxine at the moment . Um . Yes . Cool . Any drug allergies ? Are you allergic to any medications ? No , I have no medication . Allergies . No . No allergies . And you mentioned the suicide of your father 15 years ago . I'm very sorry to hear that . Is there any other , um , uh , significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions ? No . No depression or anything like that running in your family or . I think that's all . Okay . And your mother is . Is . Well . Any brothers or sisters ? Yeah . She's fine . Um . And now I'm an only child . Um . Um , okay . So I just , uh . Sorry , my slightly random question , but any , uh , change in your vision ? No , no , nothing like that . Okay . And just to go back to you saying you had low mood , some people who who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well . Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else ? No no no not not really . No . And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past ? Sometimes , I mean , I guess , um , most of the activities , but when I've been doing sports as well , um , I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe . Um , so I have some kind of , like , shortness of breath when doing sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago . Okay , so you've become more short of breath over the last few months . Yeah . Um , and you've had , uh . Okay . So , uh , any other things around this ? More fatigue , more shortness of breath , um , over the last few months . Mhm . Um , with a low mood , decreased sex drive . Um , is there just before we wrap up , is there anything else that you would like to talk about ? Um , no . Nothing specific . No . So , um , getting a little bit towards the end now , but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you . Um , I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination , and , and also , we'd probably like to do some blood tests , um , as well . So do you think it'd it would be possible to see to book an appointment in the next few days with your GP or . Um , that would be ideal , I think . Here . Um , and then we can we could probably do some more , uh , do an examination and do some investigations really , to see what's going on here a little bit more . Yeah . Is that alright ? Yeah , that's very useful . Thank you . Um , okay . Better to have some kind of plan . Um , yeah . Yeah , yeah , I think I definitely think we need a plan here . Um , it's been nice talking to you . I'm sorry . We've run out of time now . Uh , but we've at least started the ball rolling with , um , some further investigations and tests . I'm glad that you're , you know , you're although you have a low mood , um , you're , uh , you're not feeling suicidal just to confirm that , um , and you're , uh , and , uh , we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness , um , and your other symptoms . Let me see . Okay . Thank you very much for taking the time . Okay . Thank you . Thanks .
