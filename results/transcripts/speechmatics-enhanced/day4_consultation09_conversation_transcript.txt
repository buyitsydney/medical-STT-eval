Um . And so you're born in 92 , so it makes you 26 . 26 ? Yeah . And you're , um . Any shortness of breath at all with that ? Yeah . Like a little bit . Um , Yeah , a little bit short of breath . Not too bad . Uh , any cough wheeze ? Yeah , I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well . Coffee ? Coughing ? Yeah . Slight cough . Yeah . Yeah . Sore throat . Runny nose or ears ? You know , I had a cold last week , and it's not as bad as it was , but , yeah , I had a sore throat . I had a runny nose . Just feeling under the weather . Mhm . Are you feeling better now . Other than the tight chest . I mean I feel worse but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore . Right . Okay . Okay . But you know you've got this this . So you've still got , still got symptoms of a cold essentially . Yeah . The cough kind of stuck around . Uh , yeah . Okay . Are you coughing up anything ? Uh , no . And , um , do you have any other medical problems , like asthma ? Yeah . Yeah , I have asthma . I've had it for a while now . Um , and then I have , like , a hay fever , you know , some allergies to dust . Okay . Do you have any inhalers or any medications ? Um , yeah . So , uh , you know , the , um . Uh , Ventolin . It's called salbutamol . Yeah , I got that one . And then I have a steroid . Uh clenil . Clenil inhaler . Clenil modulite . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . And , um , uh , have you been using Clenil and Ventolin ? And how often have you been using them ? Um , well , to be honest , I was away at uni last week , and I forgot to bring it with me , so I haven't really in the past week . Both of them . Because . Because , um . Sorry . They ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one . Yeah , sure . About a week ago . Okay . All right . All right . So , so so you've you haven't got any clinical or any Ventolin at the moment . Not with me right now . No , I ran out . Okay . All right . Um . Um , and any drug allergies you know of ? No , no , not allergic to anything . Just like just the dust and stuff . But nothing . No drugs . Okay , great . Now , uh , do you anyone in your family had any medical problems you know , of ? Um . Yeah , my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma . Oh , when I was young , I also had eczema . And I had a milk protein allergy when I was young , too . Mhm . Okay . Um . So just , uh , do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or , um , hopes for this consultation ? Um . Not really . Like , I feel like asthma is probably a part of it , and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful . Um , it just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight , uh , in a long time . Yeah , absolutely . I can , I can imagine . Um , well , it certainly sounds like , uh , you've you've had this cold , you've got wheezy with a cough . Um , and it's nonproductive cough and you're short of breath . Uh , is the cough worse at night time ? I mean , it gets a little bit worse at night , but basically it's just pretty consistent . Yeah , it hasn't gone away . Okay . And you've got this tight , tight chest , but you say you've got chest pain . Just more of a tight chest , is it ? No . Not really pain . It's more like tight . It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in , you know ? Yeah , sure . Um , okay . Well , I would quite like to , uh , certainly get you some , uh , Ventolin . Clenil modulite . Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past ? Not in a long time . When I was young . A little bit more like back in high school . Um , but I've been pretty good at taking my my inhalers , so not not so much anymore . Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient ? As in , you know , stayed in there overnight for asthma ? Yeah , when I was in high school , I had to have a tube put down my throat . Oh , okay . So , so so you , uh , you had you went to hospital and had a , uh . So you stayed in hospital for a few days , did you ? With an asthma exacerbation ? Yeah , I did , yeah . Okay . But currently you're just on Ventolin and clinical , and you haven't got any of those steroids , those inhalers at the moment . Yeah , I've been pretty good . I've been pretty good . Just on the clinical and the salbutamol . Okay . Sorry . How old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation ? Uh , I think I was like , 17 , 16 , maybe . Sure . Okay . Um . Just to quantify how short of breath you are , um , I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you . No , you won't have , will you ? Um , are you able to , like , walk up a flight of stairs ? Okay . Walk on the flat okay , without getting too short of breath ? Or are you short of breath at rest ? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest , like , except for that feeling I was describing . It does . When I'm walking upstairs , I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be . Sure . Yeah , okay . But you're not short of breath at rest at the moment . No no no I'm not . Okay , fine . So what I think , um , and just just to go over . Is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the , uh , a prescription for your inhalers ? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this ? I just want to know that I'm okay to just , like , keep . I just don't want to have to get , um , that that intubation again . Sure . Yeah . No . Absolutely . Okay . Well , I'm really glad you talked to me today . I think what we can do is is give you a prescription for , uh , some more of the inhalers . We can get that to you within the hour , I would hope . Um , and , uh , I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids . So these are tablets which you can take for five days , two tablets in the morning , and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response . Okay . Okay . Um , now there are some side effects to the steroids , which I should really tell you about , but please read the label . It's associated with . Don't be too worried about the side effects . They're uncommon . Most , you know , most of the time these steroids are very well tolerated . And you probably have . You had them in the past . Do you know of . Sorry , sorry . You're cutting in and out a little bit there . What were you saying ? Have you had steroids in the past ? Um , I can't remember . Probably . Probably , yeah . Yeah . So , um , they they can come . They can make you . Your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high . Can give you a high blood sugar , um , and , uh , that they can also cause rash , nausea , um , headaches . But mostly it's well tolerated . And it should help your asthma an awful lot . Um , uh , what I like to do is send you these the some prescriptions for your inhalers ongoing so you can once you get better from this asthma attack , you can you can use the clinical modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN . So a Ventolin when you need to , um , when you're getting if you should start to use the Ventolin more than , uh , every three hours , uh , at any time , it's a good idea to seek medical attention . So , um , see a doctor , um , in some capacity . Uh , and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer , which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs . Better have you . Do you know what spacer is ? Have you used one before ? Yeah , yeah , somebody taught me how to use it in a while ago . I don't I don't really use it , to be honest . But have you got one . I think I do . I have one somewhere . Okay . All right . Well , um , I'll send you another one . And it has some instructions about how to use it , but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside , breathing in and out . Um , uh , for five , 5 or 10 breaths . Okay . Uh , yeah . So . Uh , was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage ? I think you got me covered . Okay . Um , and , uh , might give you some time off work as well . You can self-certify for seven days , but , uh , I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better , if you're okay with that . All right . Alrighty . Well , thank you very much . No worries . Any deterioration in your symptoms , like worsening shortness of breath , um , or just generally concerning symptoms ? Uh , pain in your chest , tightness , uh , feeling light headed ? Uh , then seek further medical attention anytime , please . Okay . All right . Sounds good . Okay . Thank you . Okay . Thank you . Bye bye . Bye bye .
