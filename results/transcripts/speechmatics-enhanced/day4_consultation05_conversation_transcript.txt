Uh , I have a bit of a pain . Pain . And I had a bit of vomiting and , uh . Yeah . So these are kind of like the . What is happening to me ? Okay , tell me how you were three days ago before this started . Did you have any medical problems ? Uh , so I have , I have , I have asthma , and I take some , uh , some , um , inhaler . Okay . I don't know , uh , I take an inhaler . Um , and , um , I have an allergy . I have an nkda allergy . Okay . I don't know if it's because I don't know . Yeah . And apart from asthma , do you have anything else ? Uh , I don't know , maybe because , you know , it's this thing here in the stomach , stuff I always have in the back of my head that my father , because he died about , um , ten years ago of cancer . Okay . So yeah , this is kind of the the my my worries . I don't know . Okay . So you've you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting . Yes yes , yes . Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse ? Uh , I think it's not getting better or worse . It's kind of like , uh . Like either . Like normal . Okay . Like it . It hasn't gone away . It hasn't worsened . Okay . And how often do you go to the toilet ? I go , I need to go , I , I can't go to work because I need to go like every I don't know , is this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish , I need to , I feel I need to go again . Okay . On . On . Yeah . So I need to be , like , close to the toilet . Uh , that must be hard . Yeah . Yeah . You have to drink more water than normal . Ah , I don't know . Maybe I'm not drinking enough water . Yeah , I drink . I think I yeah , I don't know . I think I don't drink enough water . An important question . Have you noticed any blood ? Uh , no , I haven't noticed any . Any blood . And you mentioned tummy pain . Can you tell me more about your tummy pain ? Like where it is and if it goes anywhere ? So the pain is mainly , uh , focusing in the center area of the abdomen , like under the belly , under the belly button . Yeah . And . Yeah . And sometimes I can hear my stomach , uh , like the cramps . Yeah . You've been able to eat and drink ? Uh , yes . But yes , but I , I go to the toilet so often , so I , I , I yeah , I try not to eat a lot because I . Yeah , I'm just going to the toilet every ten minutes . And you said the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy . Does it go anywhere else . No , no . Just there . And it seems to be alleviate a bit toilet . And maybe it's like trapped gas . I don't know what it is , but . Okay . And when was the last time you vomited ? I think it was this morning . This morning I . But the thing is like , because I'm not eating anything now , so I haven't vomited again . Did you have any breakfast ? I don't know , I didn't know , sorry . Yes , I did , actually I did . I had some I had some fruit . Okay . And and you vomited that up afterwards . And afterwards I didn't have anything . Then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited , and then . Yeah , that's it . And that was it . And I haven't eaten since then , so now I'm . I think I'm okay , but , uh , yeah , I don't . Yeah . Did you notice any blood when you vomit ? Um . I think I do . I think I do , but it's , uh . No , no , actually , I can't say sorry . I'm sorry , I , I , I don't think there is blood because , uh . Yeah , it was , it was strawberries that I was having for breakfast . So . So yeah . It wasn't blood . Okay . And , um , did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain ? Uh , I , I don't know , to be honest , sometimes I have , when I get a bit of anxiety , I . I use my inhaler . Yeah , but my inhaler kind of , um , ran out the one because , you know , I'm a foreigner , so I have , uh , this brand . But I bought a new one here . Okay . And , uh , I don't know , maybe this new one has caused . Okay . This problem , I don't know . Okay ? It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this . Normally , it's when you eat , um , bad food or food that has gone off , and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested , but just to double check . Have you noticed any problems with your breathing ? Uh . Uh . I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma . Like when I take Sean , I need to use my inhaler a little bit . But a part of the normal , I haven't , I haven't . Okay . And how about chest ? Have you noticed any chest pain ? Um , no I haven't . I haven't noticed any chest pain . Okay . And how about , um , walking and talking ? Are those all both okay ? Uh , walking and talking ? Uh . Yes . Uh , but , uh , but , yeah , I don't walk very far because , uh , I yeah , I need to I need to go to the toilet now and then . So I'm spending some time at home . And when you press on your tummy , does it cause any pain ? Oh , it does a little bit . Okay . Sorry . I was just writing some things down . Sure . So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain . Okay . And it's normal . This is normally called gastroenteritis . So an infection of the tummy . Okay . Normally when patients have this we do three things . Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment . Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers . So if you start getting a temperature then you need to mol . And three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better . Okay . And normally I normally things like antibiotics don't help . They make the situation worse . Okay . So that's I . Yeah . Go ahead . Sorry . No , I was saying I didn't have any fever recently . I was sweating a little bit last for bed , but I , I'm not sure if , if I had a bit of fever , but very little or But I don't think so , I don't think . I don't know , maybe so . I think that's what we should do for the time being . If you feel you're getting much worse , then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real , in real life , in person , so they can look at your belly . Okay I will yeah , I will book , then I will book . I will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then I will book . Great . Yeah . Cool . Do you have any more questions for me ? Uh , no . That's , uh . That's it . I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history . That would , uh . Yeah , could add some kind of risk . So the the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy . And less likely to be something your father had . But if your things don't get worse , then that's something that we can look at from the GP . Okay . Does that sound okay ? Yeah , that sounds good . That sounds good . Thank you very much . Thank you very much for your time . Bye bye . Bye bye .
