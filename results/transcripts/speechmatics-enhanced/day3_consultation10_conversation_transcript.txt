Hello . Hello . Hi , I'm Doctor Jacob , and welcome to Babylon . Hello . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you too . So just before we start , is it all right ? If you could confirm your name for me , please . Michael Johnson . And your date of birth ? 0929 83 . Okay . And your address for me , please . 231 Leonard London Street or . Sorry ? London . Okay . And that's correct . And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation . Yes . Okay . You've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea . I'm sorry to hear about it . So if you tell me a bit more about it , please . Uh , it's been happening for about three days now . Okay . Um , yeah , it started off , uh , was , I don't know , it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly . I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels , but , uh , nothing funky in my diet or no travels recently . Um , and it just kind of kept up . So I'm a bit confused as to what to do . So you haven't had anything from outside ? Nothing dodgy . Anything ? No no no no no . Just a little bit . Yeah I don't know . I mean it's pretty standard diarrhoea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain . I threw up once . That was a little worrying . Uh , repeat that , please . That wasn't clear . What did you say ? I threw up once . Yeah . After that , we said something . Uh , nothing else was worrisome . Okay . Right . And with the diarrhea , how many times a day are you going to the toilet ? Uh , 4 to 5 . 4 to 5 times . Yeah . And is there any . And it's like water . Is it like water or is it just loose ? Uh , what do you mean ? Are you going like water , or is it just , you know , bit , bit of solid stools , bit loose kind of thing ? It probably depends on the time of day , to be honest . A bit of both . And is there any blood or mucus ? No blood . What do you mean , mucus ? It's like the snotty stuff in the stool . Yeah , it looks like snot . No , no . So no mucus . Okay . Any fever at all ? Uh , maybe a little bit , but it hasn't been that in particular . Hasn't been too worrying . Are you still able to eat and drink ? Uh , a little bit of appetite loss , I guess , versus the normal . Okay . Um , but also not something I've like . I if that was alone , I wouldn't have reached out . So . But you're you're still able to drink quite a bit . Yeah . You're drinking plenty . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Excellent . Mostly to try and read . Okay . And , um , what have you take . Have you taken anything so far for the diarrhoea ? Nothing yet . Nothing yet . Okay . Anything for the abdominal pain ? Uh . Nothing yet . Okay . Right . And any . Unfortunately , we don't have any of your past medical history . Is there anything you'd like to say ? Uh , I . Probably at asthma . Um . Or or . I don't know , I guess I still have it . Okay . And , um , are you any anything else other than asthma ? Uh , my dad had hypertension . Okay . Has hypertension ? Yeah . Hypertension . He died of bowel cancer ten years ago . Bowel cancer ten years ago . And how old was he when he died ? Uh , 62 . Okay . And , um , you mentioned you had asthma . Are you using any inhalers at all ? Yes . Which ones ? Lexapro . Sorry . Lexapro . Lexapro ? Yes . Okay . Not heard of it ? Maybe . Is it like salbutamol ? Is it like a blue colour ? Yellow . Yellow . Okay , I'll have to check that one . Not sure . Lexapro . Okay . Um . That's fine . Any other medication that you're using over the counter ? Anything at all ? Regularly ? No . Okay . Right . Any allergies ? Um , Nothing . Yeah , nothing . No allergies at all . Right . Here ? Fine . So obviously , you know , you just have diarrhea . It's about 4 to 5 times a day . Um , you're still drinking plenty , and you look like you're not dehydrated , which is a good sign . Okay . Um , when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day , that means probably you are . You know , whatever you're eating is going straight through . Okay . You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids . Okay . When you go to the toilet , um , things that one would advise is a soft diet . So avoid dairy , fish , meat , eggs while you're having diarrhea . Go . Sorry . What is a soft diet ? What is that like outside of not those things ? What do you mean by soft ? Okay , so that will be like crackers , toast , jam , those kind of things . That's easily digested . Like what you would give babies when they start eating . You give simple food for babies . You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding . So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about . Yeah . Once you are able to , you know , keep most of it in , you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash . Once you're okay with that for about 48 hours , then you can start having meat . So just don't have meat immediately . Once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again . All right . Okay . With that diet like once , what , 48 hours ? You're not having any diarrhea . You're fine . Then you can go and start having meat , egg , fish . And so that even if diarrhea is getting better but isn't getting or do you want it to go away completely at that point , or if it's like trending upwards ? No , no no , preferably just don't . Because why do we say this ? This because it takes much more time for me to get digested . So because your gut flora , you know , the the the bacteria in your gut is not , you know , as it should be . It takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food . While it doesn't take that much of an effort to , you know , digest , mash and vegetables . Does that make sense ? Yes . Yeah . So , um , at the same time , you could have some . Although you can't . Milk is not a good idea . Yogurts are a good idea because they're probiotics . It helps to build up the normal gut bacteria back . Okay , okay . So those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood . We need a stool sample because that means you might you may have some , um , some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics . Okay . Okay . If you again , as I've mentioned previously , if you're going about 6 to 8 times a day , that means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time . If that happens , do get in touch with us again . All right . Okay . Any questions ? You look a bit confused . No . That's it . Yeah . Okay . And also , you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter . So it helps to replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet . Okay . Okay . If you're a bit confused , you know , you can actually , uh , all this is all recorded in your app , so you can go back . I'll put that all in detail . So if you know , I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything . You can go back and read . Read the notes . Is that okay ? That's great . All right then you take care . Bye . Bye now . Bye bye .
