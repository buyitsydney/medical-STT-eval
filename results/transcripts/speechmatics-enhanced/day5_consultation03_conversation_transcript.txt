Hi there . I'm Doctor Smith from Babylon . Hi . Hi there . Can you just confirm your name ? Date of birth in the first line of your address ? First of all , please . Yes . My name is Valerie Paul . My date of birth is the 19th of September , 1993 . My address is 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon . Okay . Are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today ? Yes , I am , yeah . What can I do for you ? Um . I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months . Um , I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house , and it started to really worry me and just add up and build up that anxiety . And I just didn't know who to talk to , so I wanted to check with my GP . Okay . Do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started ? Do you think there's something which changed in my life at that time . Um , I guess so . I think , um , I would say maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this , and that's probably coincides with me starting a new job . Um , which I would say it's quite I mean , every job is stressful when you first start , but it's been really stressful , I think , over the past two months . Definitely . What's your job ? Um , so I work for a , uh , a fashion retailer in and the head office team , and it's just a brand new sector . I've never worked in retail before . My boss is not very nice to me . Um , but I also think that it's just been . I just really dread going there . I just hate speaking to her . I hate seeing everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not . And it's really impacting on , like on the rest of my life , like my sleep and stuff like that . Okay , so , um , just day to day . Tell me from the start of your day how it affects you . Said you you dread going to work . How how does it affect you in terms of , like , your sleep at night and things like that ? Yeah . So I , as I say , like I don't want to go to work in the morning , so I just find no way of I can't get out of bed . But it's also because when I leave , I just when I've left work , I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done . I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours . Okay , so what time do you go to bed at night time ? About ten . 11 . And what time do you get to sleep ? Not for ages . I'm lying awake all night . Okay , um , when you eventually get to sleep , do you wake up with your alarm in the morning , or does something else wake you up before then ? So I find my heart kind of racing , and then I'm just , like , panicking that I'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful . So I do have an alarm , but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just my heart is racing . And actually the other day I was just like I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much . I thought I was going to have a heart attack in the morning . Okay . And so how many hours sleep do you think you get at night ? I just , I can't even tell because I feel like I'm even when I'm in sleep . It's such a shallow sleep . But maybe three , four hours I'm getting now . Okay . And what about your eating patterns ? Any change in how you're eating or whether your appetite's changed ? Probably not . Significant changes , maybe ? No , I wouldn't say that . I wouldn't say I'm eating like much differently . Oh , I probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down . Okay , you're eating regularly otherwise . Yeah . And you told me about the palpitations . Just tell me a bit more about that . Yeah . So , um , it's usually kind of like when I realize in the morning that either , um , I feel like I'm going to be late because I've overslept , because I'm so tired . Um , or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm going to be late . So it's just kind of like just a constant , like , rapid heart beating . It's just really , really stressful . I don't know if it's stress or if I did think it was like a heart problem initially . Does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat ? Irregular , I think . And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it ? Oh , it can be anything . I think a couple of minutes or the other day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes . Okay . Is that something that you've had before this or is that a new thing ? Yeah , I would say this is only in the past , sort of like couple of months , as I say , that I've been experiencing this . Okay . Any chest pain with that ? No . Um . Well , yeah . It's painful to when the heart . When my heart is beating fast . But . Okay . But . Yeah . And in the daytime . How how ? You said you're not getting much sleep . So how's your energy level in the daytime ? It's just really , really low . And I'm finding now that I'm just I find no enjoyment at all kind of day to day . And anything that I'm doing , it's not just my job . It's , you know , when I leave , I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not it's not enjoyable . And I'm like , yeah , on edge the whole time . Okay , so what do you do in the evenings ? Well , right now I'm working so late because everything is really , really stressful . So I don't really get much time for myself . But when I do want to go out or see friends or just relax , it seems quite difficult to do that . Okay . And are you avoiding contact with friends or do you still see them ? I avoid them insomuch that I feel like I'm . Yeah . So I mean , sometimes it just I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done . Okay . What about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work ? Do you do anything else outside work ? Yeah , as I say , like everything that I had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with like I did . Used to like to like go running and , um , to play tennis and stuff , but now it's just not . I'm just not enjoying it . I'm not . I'm not like , I'm not going out to do that quite so much . And has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work ? No , because I think that would just add to the tension . But I do pretty much every morning I think , oh , I should call in sick or like , okay , let's not go . And what's the worst that it's got ? Have you ever been , um , so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office you couldn't go into a situation of panic attack ? No , I wouldn't say so . I think I've always managed to make it to work . But I wonder if it's building up . So this is why I wanted to call . I'm just worried it's building up that I don't know what to do . Because I have felt it get worse and worse over the past month . And apart from work , are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety like being in public places , social situations , public transport , anything like that ? Yeah , I mean , I find public transport really stressful in a way , especially being on the tube because it's quite getting warmer . So it's just really airless . Um , but I think the majority of it , because my life is just so focused around work right now , the majority of it is focused on work as well . Okay . Before this , did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this ? Not really . I know I would say . I mean , everybody always has a bit of tension , a bit of anxiety , but I've never felt anything this bad before . Okay . And what about your mood day to day ? I mean , I can see that you're quite distressed by it , but do you ever get really down about this ? Um , I mean , yeah . Yeah , because I do . Yeah . I'm pretty much down , like , I don't enjoy being around my day at all because I'm just so worried about everything . Um , and I find that even when I'm not , like , even at the weekends and stuff , it's just the kind of , like , constant feeling of just being a bit down , a bit unhappy . When do you think you last felt yourself ? Um . I don't know if that's a good question . I can't really I can't really put a date on that at all . And your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job , or with your life , or with your normal things as they were going on ? I wouldn't know . I wouldn't say that I've had I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme . Like , I don't , you know , I have I have a good support system , like I do have a good family and stuff . So I have I don't have worries about actually wanting to not go on . It's just that I don't want to go on like this . Yeah . Okay . And where do you who do you live with at home ? Sorry . Who do you live with at home ? Yeah , I live with my parents . Just my parents . Um . And how much alcohol do you have in an average week , do you think ? Um , I don't know , probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday , just because that's kind of normal . Um , maybe . Maybe I do have , like , a bit during the week . Like , my parents obviously are retired , so they just drink whenever they want . So whenever they're having a glass of wine , they'll offer it to me . And it's like , I guess I don't really keep track of it that much . Okay , so how much would you . Would you guess ? Probably like probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out . So maybe like I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway . And then like maybe a glass of wine during the week . Okay . Do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything ? Um , I try not to smoke , but I do occasionally , but I don't take drugs . Okay . And have you done anything yourself to help ? Have you . Have you talked to anyone , talk to any counselors , done any online , looked online at all ? Anyways , I talked to my mom because she also suffers from or she's suffered from like depression in the past , I didn't think that it was that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as , as as just stress the whole time . But , um , I did talk to my mom about it , but I haven't thought any . She recommended that I come to the GP . Um , I haven't got any other and wouldn't be happy to have some 1 to 1 therapy . Yeah . Yeah , I think so . I've never done that before , but yeah . Okay . I mean , what we would suggest in the first instance is to , to so you can self-refer via the NHS for what we call like talking therapy , which type of behavioural therapy where they can really look at your situation , how you're reacting to the what's provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that . Um , so I can send you the link for that , um , in the meantime , so it can be a bit of a wait . There are some online resources that are really helpful . Um , put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well . Um , and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all , or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day , then it's important for us to for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further . I mean , some people with anxiety , they do need to take medication to control that , but that's not something that we suggest in the first instance . Okay . And I'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that . That's great . I look forward to reading it . Um , in terms of palpitations , it is most likely to be associated with anxiety , but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off , and then arranging a GP follow up a week after you've had the test , so we can just go through the results with you . Okay . Okay . Yeah . So if you call the support line , you can arrange to have the blood test done . Okay , I'll call them up . Okay . Thank you so much . All right . Take care . Have a good day . Bye . Sorry .
