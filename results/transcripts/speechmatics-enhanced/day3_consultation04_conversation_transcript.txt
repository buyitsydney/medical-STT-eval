Hi . Hi . Hello , I'm Doctor Jacob , and welcome to Babylon . Hello . Hi . Hi . So , just before we start , is it all right ? If you could confirm your name for me , please ? Yes , my name . And your date of birth ? 14th of July , 1996 . And your address for me , please . And 28 Quex Road , S.W. , 19 01EZ . That's correct . And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation . Thank you . Okay , so you mentioned in your notes that you've got some tightness . If you would like to tell me a bit more about it , please . Yeah . So about 2 to 3 days ago I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran , but I found myself actually short of breath . Um , I'm not really sure of breath when I'm walking . Um , but definitely , um , if I'm walking briskly now , um , and I've used my blue inhaler , but to no avail , it hasn't really helped me . Mhm . Um , so yeah . So I'm having I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath wheezing and coughing . Okay . And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler . So how often are you using the blue inhaler . Um , I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms . Yeah . So , um , at the moment you are having shortness of breath . So are you using it every day at the moment ? Um , yeah . And morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well . Okay . And um , which colour . What's the name of your preventer ? Um it's blue . Um , I think in totality , um , my history is salbutamol , clenil , etc. and hydrocortisone that I'm taking as well . Okay . So could you repeat that salbutamol clenil . Uh , cetraben . And hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone . So you have eczema also . Yeah . What's that ? Sorry . You do have a history of eczema ? Um , I brothers asthmatic and my sister has asthma and I've got a few issues , um , that I think could be eczema as well . Okay . Right . So coming back to your , um , you know , your shortness of breath , you've mentioned your wheezing and your coughing . Are you bringing up any phlegm at all ? Um , no , I don't , um , I'm not coughing up much sputum . Okay . No sputum . Okay . Right . And , um , how are you using your , um , your clenil . So are you using it every day ? Um , I think I'm using that every day . And the salbutamol is just , like , as and when . So how are you using the clenil ? Is it twice a day ? Um . Yes . Twice . Okay . And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad ? Um , no , I haven't . Okay . Right . When was the last time you had an asthma attack ? Um , about 3 to 4 years ago . 3 to 4 years ago . And what what did the DP do at that time ? Um , just , um , encouraged me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative . Okay . So you didn't have any steroids or steroids or antibiotics ? Not that I can remember . Okay . Um , okay . Have you ever had oral steroids in the past ? Um , no . When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse ? Um , about two years ago . Okay . Two years ago . Okay . But your asthma was pretty under control till . Till now , isn't it ? Uh , yes . In the last two days . So do you do a peak flow meter at home ? Peak flow reading where you blow into . You know , do you do that ? No . Um , just every now and then . I haven't done it over the last since I've had symptoms . Okay , so what was what's your peak flow reading when you're good . Like normally peak flow reading . Um , I think 100 130 . Okay . Let's say it's about , um , 380 . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Right . So that's your normal ? Yeah . Right here . Okay . So what we need . Okay . Do you have any allergies at all ? Um , I have hay fever . Sorry . Could you repeat that , please ? Sorry , I have hay fever . Okay . Okay . Any allergies to medication ? Oh , no . Sorry . Okay . So you're not allergic to anything ? Okay . So no allergies . Okay . Excellent . Right here . So what ? We need to do that . Obviously we . You haven't had asthma for some time , and it looks like you can't be having a small , small exacerbation . So what ? I would like you to be seen by one of our GPS in the next few days . In the interim , what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when , okay . And use it maximum about every 2 to 4 four hours . But if you're using it that often , that means pretty much that your asthma is really bad . You can use it , but that's not ideal . The blue , the brown in your clenil the brown inhaler . You can up the dose . If you're using just two puffs twice a day , you can increase it to four puffs twice a day . Yeah . And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us . Now , I mentioned , you know , you're doing what ? You know , increase the clenil to four puffs twice a day , and you're using the asthma , you know , the blue inhalers every 2 to 4 hours and your breathing is getting really worse , then you would need to take yourself to A&E . You shouldn't wait for our appointment . Okay , so when the doctor sees you , what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest . Yeah . Make you do the peak reading . So depending on what we find , you might need some antibiotics or some steroids . But anyway , while you're at home we are going to by increasing your clenil , we are increasing your steroid intake anyway . Okay . So yeah . So any questions you wanted to ask me ? I think yeah . So book an appointment call or book an appointment to see . And I will recommend that you need a face to face in the interim , increase your brown inhalers to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly . But if your breathing is getting worse and you've not seen us , you take yourself to A&E . All right . Okay . Okay . Thank you so much for your time . You're welcome . Take care then . Bye bye . Bye bye .
