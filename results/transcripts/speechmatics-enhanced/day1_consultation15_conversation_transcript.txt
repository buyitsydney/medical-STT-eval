Uh , I mean , I am . I do work as a housekeeper . Um , and to be honest , I'm not always very good about wearing gloves . Um , so that could be related . Um , I switched jobs , uh , four months ago . Okay . I've been working for as a housekeeper for for a while , though . But , um , that's the only thing I can think of . Yeah , I think I might be quite important . I think that's definitely maybe a correlation between the two . Um , fine . And so you mentioned something about having general dryness is that you mentioned your legs as well . Yeah . Sorry . Is that something you've had for a while now ? Yeah , it's not really . It's not really major . Um , yeah . It's just a little bit of dryness in my legs . Right . Okay . Okay .

I haven't been able to go to work . Okay . All right . Can I ask a couple of questions ? Do you smoke at all ? No . Do you drink much in the way of alcohol ? Pints a week . Once a week . Uh , a couple of pints a week . Couple of pints a week . Okay . So , very minimal alcohol there . Um , have you tried anything for your symptoms ? Have you tried anything over the counter ? Acne creams ? Yeah , I've tried E45 . Any luck with that ? Yeah . No , it didn't really do anything . No . Okay . All right . Um . And and and I , uh . But it didn't help . Okay . All right . Um . Mrs. . Parkington . So I think , um , based on your story , I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis , which is very common in particularly people in your , in your , in your field who are using cleaning products , not using gloves . You can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin . Um , so moving forward there's a couple of options . So firstly , what we try and do is , you know , avoid the triggers . In your case , I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times . Okay . In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin , um , we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation as well as some stronger emollients , um , which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day three , four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin . Okay . Um , if this still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time , I really need to come back and see me again , and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you . Okay . Is that all clear ? Uh , yeah . That sounds good . Great . Do you have any questions for me ? Um , where do I get the medicines from ? So I'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy . Okay , great . Yeah . Um , so you said a couple of weeks it should get better , I think . I think minimum a couple of weeks , uh , ten days to 14 days . Um , and if it still hasn't got better , or indeed , if it's getting worse , if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse , come back and see me sooner . Okay . Great . Thank you . Laura . Thank you . Thank you very much . Bye bye now . Okay .
