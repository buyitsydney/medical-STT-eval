Hi . Hello . Hi , I'm Doctor Jacob , and welcome to Babylon . Hello . Hi , hi . So , um , just before we start , is it alright if you could confirm your name for me , please ? Sure . My name is Mary Smith . And your date of birth ? My date of birth is August 16th , 1976 . And your email address for me , please . My email address is Mary Smith at gmail.com . That's correct . And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation . Absolutely . All right . So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw . Is that correct ? Um , well , I think that's just like the first thing that I typed , but , uh , it wasn't really what I , you know , I just typed it and then I clicked submit . So that was , uh , um , I mean , it's part of the problem , but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm . I mean , I can move it , but it's it's numb . And then I also feel some tingling in my fingertips . Okay , so numbness in the left arm . Yeah . Yes . How long has it been going on for ? So I've started taking this boxing class . I've been taking boxing class for a few weeks , and I feel like maybe , um . It's probably been , I'd say , for at least two weeks , and it's kind of gotten worse . Like , I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling , and then it's gotten it's gotten worse since then . Then the numbing kind of started . I can feel it both in my , uh , um , you know , a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand . And so now , because it hasn't gotten better , I tried to get a massage . It's not better or , you know , try to take warm baths . It's not better . So I figured I'd call you and and just figure out what's going on . Right . So , have you mentioned a massage and a warm bath ? Any medications that you've taken so far ? Um , well , it's , you know , it's it's numb and I , I kind of looked stuff online . Um , but , you know , I do take ibuprofen just because my , my muscles were sore , um , a little bit . And I've been taking this boxing class . So , you know , I kind of heard , like , my knuckles on my right hand , so that's been a little bit painful . So I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that . Okay . But like I said , I mean , I tried massage , I tried some hot baths , and that didn't help with this numbness thing . Sure . I'm just kind of getting a little worried . Of course . Also from you've just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards is that , you know , tingling numbness is elbow , not from your shoulder ? Um , well , it's kind of funny . You know , sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder , like , if I try to . If I try to like , you know , move like in boxing and stuff , I will even , like , um , maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain . Uh , but I would say if I'm just , like , resting , if I'm sitting , like , right now , I can feel like it's numb . And I actually feel tingling right now . Not in all of my fingers . Just in some . Yeah . So which fingers do you feel ? Numb . Okay , so it's my second , third and fourth finger . Second , third and fourth finger . And is it your palm side or , you know , the back of your hand side which is numb or both . No , it's it's the it's this side . So the front side . It's the front side . Okay . Right . And have you been dropping things at all like , you know , when you try to hold on to things like a glass or something . Have you dropping it ? So not so much with the glass , but I will say , um , well , I play a little bit of a piano . And so I just noticed that it's , it's been kind of harder to get the notes . I can , I can grasp . I can grasp a glass , but because I use my right hand most of the time , you know I'm not left handed , so it's kind of hard for me to . So you would say there's a mild weakness . Mild ? Yes . So just to get my facts right , so you say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain . You can't hold it . There's two different things . You know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you . No , no , it's not hurting . It's not hurting . It's like numb . I can't feel it . Right . Okay . Yeah , fine . So you have definitely having some sort of some form of weakness . Okay . Absolutely . Any neck pain at all ? No , not no neck pain . Neck pain . Okay . Right . Okay . So just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system . Um , do you have any past medical history that you'd like to share ? Well , I guess because of this , you know , I'm not sure if it's boxing . I also had a really bad cold like a month ago . I mean , I was out , you know , drinking with friends . Um , one of our coworkers just had his three year anniversary , and we kind of went crazy and we were out partying until , you know , late hours . And I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me . And then after that , I was sick for probably a good like two weeks I was at home . I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something . So that and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like , I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the , uh , from my left eye . Like I lost some , like , a little bit of a field of vision . Um , and but that that just lasted not very long . I mean , that just lasted maybe for , I don't know , 20 , 20 minutes . Uh , and I kind of thought , I don't know , maybe it was the , the cold , you know , and the virus and all that . So , um , I guess that's what I can , you know , that's the last thing I can remember . But in general , I'm . I'm pretty healthy . I mean , I , you know , I work out a lot and I don't really have any medical problems . Do you have any headaches at all from the in the recent past ? Um , sometimes I get headaches , but I think they're just tired . Headaches . You know , sometimes I'll get kind of tired , but I think that's probably because I work too much or , you know , because , like , I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself . And then I just kind of feel this fatigue . Uh , or sometimes , like this morning , for example , I just felt really fatigued , and I couldn't even get myself to the gym . But , you know , since I have this numbness , it's kind of like , hard to work out , right ? Do you wear glasses at all ? Glasses ? Contact lenses ? No , no . So no glasses , right . And you've not had experienced anything like a seizure or fit anything like that . What's a seizure like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking ? Oh no no no no , nothing like that . No fits . Yeah . Okay . And your weakness is only in your left arm . Leg walking and all this normal . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . Walking is normal . Yeah . You mentioned for a while you couldn't see , you know , the outside peripheral vision from your left eye . How long did that episode last for ? You know , I think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so . It's almost like it happened and I thought , oh , my God , it's probably I'm still like , sick from this , you know , virus thing . Cold . And so I just kind of slept it off . And then when I , um , when I woke up , it was gone . Sure . Okay . Um , okay . So is there any regular medications that you're using ? Not really . I just take ibuprofen . Every once in a while . I take vitamin D , um , I take some . I like my GP . My GP really wants me to take iron supplements , but , you know , there are this , like , huge pill . So I , I'm most of the time I just forget . But vitamin D I take and then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep . Okay . All right . And any family history you'd like to share ? Any significant family history ? I know that my dad has . I don't know if it's hypo . I think it's hypothyroidism . Yeah . And then my , like , he's got some autoimmune stuff going on . Like that much I know . And then my mom , my mom , she's she's actually not in a great shape . She's got diabetes type two . She's got hypertension . Um , she's got gosh . What is it ? Oh , yeah . She's got high cholesterol . Um , and I think that's it for her . Yeah . Right . Any neurological conditions in the family are related conditions ? No . Okay . That's fine . Okay . So . Right . So after , you know , speaking and examining , you know , your cell phone , I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further . I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here . Okay . A few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is , for instance , um , you know , when you said you can't , your vision went , your peripheral vision was not there for about 20 . So . And that with the weakness of the arms make me think , is there something else going on rather than just an injury ? What do you think may be going on ? So sometimes , you know , you do get things like Miss Multiple sclerosis . So people with multiple sclerosis can have , um , visual problems like what you've experienced . And sometimes , you know , the odd numbness , tingling sensations going on . Okay . Oh , my God , will I be in a wheelchair If we catch it a bit early , there are treatments for it . Okay . I'm not obviously , I'm not suggesting that you do have it , but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not . That's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here . Yeah . So what I'll do is I'm going to do an urgent , very urgent neurology referral . Yeah . What they what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that . Hello . I see yeah . Yeah . I'm here , I'm here . I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you . Um , but . But I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously . All right . Yeah , that makes sense . Okay . Any questions at all ? Well , what's . Okay . So you're going to do the referral . Um , should I be taking any drugs or . No , that's something we can't do . the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that . When you have an acute , you know , acute reaction or things like that , but saying that first we need to firm diagnosis . Yeah . Yes . Why you're waiting for this to be done if there's any weakness . Uh , you know , if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches , vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better , then that would be an A&E . Okay . Got it . All right . Sounds good . Okay . Thank you . Doctor . Yeah , I'm . I'm sorry . I do appreciate you are a bit worried , but , you know , it's good that you know that you've come and spoken to us today and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling . Okay . Thank you doctor . Appreciate your time . That's okay . You take care . Bye bye . Bye . Bye now . Bye .
