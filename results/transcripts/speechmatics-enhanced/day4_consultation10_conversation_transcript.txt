If , in the meantime , between now and and me or a GP seeing you , you feel worse in any way . You get lightheaded . Um , you , uh , you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you ? Um , then I think take them quite seriously and see somebody more urgently if possible . Um , okay . Is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now ?
