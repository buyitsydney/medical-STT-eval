Um , I'm sorry to hear work's been so stressful . Um , tell me more about your skin . Firstly , tell me you mentioned it's been dry and itchy . Um , whereabouts in your skin ? All over my arms . Um . And my hands mainly . Okay . Um . And is this something you've had before ? Uh , no . So it did it did it come about quite suddenly , or was it more kind of a gradual thing ? I think it started a few days ago . Okay . And has it spread anywhere else ? Has it spread to your to your chest , your legs ? Your face ? No . Okay , so apart from being dry and itchy , um , any other symptoms has been sore ? Has it been ? Uh , have you noticed any cracked skin ? Um , so my skin is quite red . Um , and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days . Okay . Because I see spots . Okay . No fevers . I'm not sweating either . Thank you for mentioning all those . Um . Okay . Uh , so the coconut butter hasn't helped with the itch ? No . Okay . And , uh , you mentioned work's been quite stressful . What do you do for work ? Um , I work as a teacher . Okay . And , uh , in what way has work been stressful ? I think the kids have been really annoying these days . Okay . Well , working really long hours . Okay . All right , well , I'm sorry to hear that , and I hope it gets better . Um , going back to your skin , is there anything you've done ? Perhaps , uh , which may have triggered your symptoms . Anything you've touched or , for example , shower gels , soaps , fabric , fabric cleaners . I mean , I went swimming a few days ago . Okay . So the first time in your life . Or have you been before ? Uh , no , I've been before . Okay . And did your symptoms start after you went swimming ? Yes . Okay . All right . Um , you mentioned you've had no other fevers . Is that right ? No fevers , no vomiting ? No , no . How's your health otherwise ? It's pretty good . Yeah . I'm not on any medication . Okay , we'll get to medication . Just a second . Um , do you do you feel generally run down ? Do you feel tired ? Uh , yeah , I think I have been quite tired . Okay . Okay . Are you eating and drinking okay ? Yeah . I've been drinking and eating as normal . Appetite is fine . Is it okay ? And your bowels ? Are your bowels working okay ? Yeah . And , no . No problems with vomiting or loose stools . No . Okay . And your waterworks are all okay . You pass urine . Okay ? Yep . Okay . All right . Um , so just moving on . In terms of your other medical history , is there anything else I should be aware of ? I'm currently taking microgynon . Microgynon . Yeah . Okay . Do you know what that is ? Uh , no . Okay . It's a contraceptive pill . Okay . Does that make sense ? Is that something you . Does that ring a bell now ? Yeah . Okay . Is it . Any other medications that you take ? Uh , no . No . So in terms of your medical history , there's no problems of skin problems in the past . Things like eczema or other dermatitis . No . I think I might just be the weather . Sorry . Was that you think it's . I think it might just be the weather . The weather ? Yeah . Oh . You think ? Okay . You think the weather ? Okay . That's okay . No . No problems . Um . Do you do you suffer from allergies ? Are you someone who suffers from allergies ? Um , allergies ? Medication ? Allergies ? I think , um , I might be lactose intolerant . Lactose intolerant . Okay . That could be helpful to know . Um , fine . In terms of family history , is there anything a family that you're aware of ? Um . Yeah . So , um , my dad has asthma and my mum has high fever . Hay fever ? Yep . Okay . Um , fine . Any again ? Any skin problems I should be aware of ? Uh , no . No . Okay . All right . Socially , who do you live with at home ? It's just me . Live alone ? Yep . And , uh , do you smoke at all ? Do you can ask ? Do you smoke ? Are you a smoker ? Um , no , I don't smoke . Do you drink much in the way of alcohol ? Uh , no . Recreational drugs ? Yes . Okay . And you said you you work as a primary school teacher ? Yes . That's right . The reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor . Um , you felt you noticed yourself finding your life's been more stressful recently . All right . Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms ? I mean , I don't I don't think so . Okay . All right . Um , fine . Um . Okay . Well , normally at this stage , I'd like to proceed to examination , but , um , based on your story , um . It's difficult . I think , you know , you've essentially the stories . You've got dry , itchy rash on your men , your hands . You mentioned , um , and your arms , which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago . Um , um , but no other symptoms . You're feeling otherwise ? Well , no fevers , no bleeding or discharge from the skin . I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis . Um , have you heard of that condition before ? I have , yeah . Okay . Um , great . Well , I can give you a patient information leaflet about that , which gives you more information about the disease , but , um , it's something that we can readily treated , um , with a couple of options . We have steroid creams I can give you , um , which will help with the inflammation and , uh , something called emollients , which can help with the dry , dry skin . And that's something you just need to kind of paste on , uh , onto your skin , uh , throughout the day for the next few days . Um , and hopefully that helps your symptoms . Okay . Cool . Thank you very much . Um , you can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter . Piriton loratadine . That can sometimes help with itchiness . Yeah , that sounds good . Okay . And , um , that's probably what I recommend . Paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful . Um , painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion , but let's , let's let's see how the next few days go . And if you're still not getting better , come back and see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms . Okay . Perfect . Thank you very much . Do you have any questions for me ? Uh , no . Okay . Well , wish you all the best . Have a good day . Thank you very much . Bye .
