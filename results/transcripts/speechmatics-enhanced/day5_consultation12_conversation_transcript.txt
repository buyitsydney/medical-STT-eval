It's on the left side at the back . Sort of . Here . Okay . Just on the left side ? Yes . And when did it start ? What time did it start ? Yesterday . About mid morning . And how did it feel when it first started ? Um , just quite intense and kind of quite throbbing . It kind of built up gradually over a short period of time . Okay . And did you get have you got any other symptoms along with that ? Any nausea , vomiting , tingling , numbness or weakness anywhere ? No , nothing . Okay . And . Um , any blurred vision or any pain over your eyes ? Um , no . Any any funny lights or anything like that in your area ? Any problems when you look into the light ? No . Um . And have you been eating and drinking okay ? Yes , yes . Like normal . Are you feeling sick or vomiting or anything ? No , nothing like that . Any high fevers ? Are you feeling shivery ? Sweaty ? No . No fever . Any rashes at all ? Nope . And in the past , have you had any headaches before ? Not really . Okay . How about would you say the headache is from 0 to 10 ? If ten is the worst pain that you could have . And zero is nothing . I'd say about eight . Okay . And have you taken any painkillers ? Um , I took some , um , um , Nurofen yesterday . Okay . And did that make any difference ? Not really . Okay . And last night , did you manage to sleep through the night ? Okay . Uh , yes I did . Has it been worse at any particular time of the day ? No , it hasn't made any difference . The time of the day . Any difference ? If you lie down , stand up , bend over , cough or sneeze or anything like that ? Um , no . And have you got any other medical problems ? Um , no I haven't . Anything you take medication for ? No , I don't , um , any over-the-counter medications or allergies ? No , only the Nurofen I took yesterday . Ibuprofen and any stomach problems or asthma at all ? No . Anyone in your family got any medical problems . My mother's had hypertension and she does get migraines . Okay . And have you had your blood pressure checked at all ? Um , no . Not recently . And who do you live with at home ? Sorry . Who'd you live with at home ? My partner . And what's your job ? Day to day ? I'm a designer . Have you had to miss any work at all ? Uh , no . But I don't feel that I'm finding it really hard to to do any of my work or normal things . Okay . Um . And do you smoke at all normally ? No I don't . Do you drink any alcohol regularly ? No . Um . And any other drugs ? No . No . Okay . Um . I mean , the fact that you haven't had headaches before , um , is unusual . The fact that they've developed . Is there anything you think's changed ? Any increased stress or change in your diet or lifestyle ? Not that I can . Not that I can think of . Okay . So what we would suggest is trying a slightly stronger pain relief . Um , so similar to ibuprofen , but taking it instead of ibuprofen . Not at the same time and taking that regularly with food . Um , hopefully that will settle it down . You can take paracetamol along with that . Try and , um , take rest , have lots of good hydration . Um , but if the pain's getting worse or you get new symptoms fever , rash , vomiting , neck stiffness , um , or you keep getting episodes of the same type of thing , then we need to speak to you and make a plan for for what we can do next . Okay . Thank you . Any other questions ? How long do you think it will last for ? Well , I should think it should go down if it's getting worse or not settling in the next day or two , then certainly give us a call back . If when you've tried the medication that I've prescribed from the pharmacy . Okay . Okay . Thank you . All right then . Thanks a lot . Bye bye .
