Still just kind of throbbing . Yeah . Have you had any changes in your skin ? No . Skin's been fine . Have you checked your temperature at all ? Have you got a thermometer at home ? Um , I haven't . Um , I don't feel like I'm feverish , but I haven't checked . And any problems with weakness ? Tingling , numbness in your arms or legs ? No , not at all . And what have you been doing since it came on ? Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home ? Um , taking some painkillers . Mainly been at home ? Um , yeah . Just kind of , kind of seems to be worse when I'm in a light room or like , sunlight . So I've kind of just been staying in as much as possible . Okay . Does it get worse with any position that you're in ? Is it worse when you lie flat or when you bend forward ? Um , no . I think I've generally been lying down better that way . Any problems if you cough or sneeze ? Uh , no , I haven't really got cough or anything . Okay . Um , can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past ? Have you had any significant medical problems , any hospital admissions operations or anything like that ? Uh , no . Not recently . Nothing . Do you take any medication ? Uh , no . Just contraception . And which contraception do you take ? Microgynon . When did you start that one ? Uh , about six years ago . Do you get any side effects from it ? Um . Not really . Um , no . Not too much . Okay . And anyone in your family had any medical problems ? Uh , my mum had a high blood pressure , and she's got a history of migraines . Um , affected me before . And have you had your blood pressure checked recently ? Uh , I haven't actually . No . Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done ? Yeah . Yeah . So probably about six months ago . Do you know if there's been any problems with it ? Um , it's always been fine , I think . Okay . Um . And whereabouts ? Whereabouts do you live at the moment ? You've given me your address . Who do you live with at home ? Uh , just with housemates . Um . Just friends . Okay . Do you drink much alcohol ? Day to day . Um , I say a normal amount . Um , probably , you know , a few drinks at the weekend . Okay . Do you smoke ? No . Did you take any other drugs of any sort ? No . Um , so what tablets did you say you've been taking already ? Sorry . What tablets have you been taking already ? For it ? Uh . Just paracetamol . Um , I'm allergic to aspirin , so I haven't been taking that . What happens when you get when you take aspirin ? Um . I just feel really sick . Okay . And have you ever taken any non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen , naproxen or anything like that ? Um , I have in the past . I haven't been taking it the last few days . Okay . Um , so this headache is new to you , and you've . You've not had regular headaches before . Yep . What I would suggest is taking , um , some anti-inflammatories along with the paracetamol . Okay . Um , as you said , you're eating okay . Yeah , yeah . Fine . I mean , from the sounds of it , it does sound quite like a migraine . But obviously you've had no history of that in the past . Um , and has anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might have triggered it ? Uh , not that I can think of . Um , I've been a bit stressed out at work , that kind of thing . Yeah . Um , well , that would be the first thing to do is to take some anti-inflammatories along with paracetamol . Make sure you're really well hydrated , um , and see how that goes . And if it isn't settling or it's getting worse , or you get any other change in your headache , um , or you're unwell with it with a high temperature , then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that . The other thing is if you if you're getting persistent headaches or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle or certain things seem to trigger these headaches , then it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out if we can help that longer term . Okay , brilliant . Thank you . Um , I would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked if you haven't had it checked for a while . Um , okay . Thing to do is to have a thermometer at home , so you make sure that your temperature is okay . Yeah . If you have a raised temperature or headaches just getting worse , or you develop any rashes or anything like that , then we'd need to speak to you straight away . Yep . Okay . That's fine . Okay . So I'll take some and I'll , um , hopefully be a bit better in a day or two then , but . Yeah . Okay . So have you got any other questions ? Uh , no . That was it today . Okay . Okay , then we'll we'll we'll , um , speak to you again . Okay . Thanks so much . Very much . Bye bye .
