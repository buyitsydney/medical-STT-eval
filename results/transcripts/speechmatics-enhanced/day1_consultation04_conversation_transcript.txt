Alex . Oh , hello . Hi . Can you hear me ? Yeah . Okay , great . Um , how can I help you this morning , sir ? Hi . So I've been feeling . I've been feeling kind of , uh , under the weather for the past four days . Um , it started with a , um , a sore throat and runny nose , and it sort of , um , it sort of going into a cough now , um , the sore throat is kind of going away , but , um , I'm starting to cough . Mhm . Okay . So it's kind of , uh , bad and tired . Um . Okay . Um , so I think there's a lot going on there . Um , so let's start with your , your sore throat first . Um , tell me a bit more about that if you can . Um , so I , you know , I think I it all started with the colleague of mine . She just kept sneezing next to me all the time . I think her kids are catching something from the , uh , from their kindergarten or something . And , uh , you know , the it it started as normal sore throat and , you know , was quite painful for a couple of days , but then it was passed . Okay . Okay . Did you have any difficulty or pain on swallowing ? Um , yeah . Yeah , it was , uh , it was quite painful to swallow . Okay . For one of those days . Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror ? Um , no . Not really . No . Okay . You didn't . You didn't notice any abnormal white spots or redness at the back of your throat ? Um , no . Um , I didn't think about , um , looking . That's okay . That's okay . And you mentioned the runny nose . Um , again . What kind of discharge is coming out ? Is it clear or is it a bit more coloured ? Yeah . Yeah , it's it's clear , but sort of , Um , sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time . It's very hard to , uh , to get it free . Okay , so you feel quite congested , G . Yeah . Quite congested . Okay , fine . Um , you also mentioned a cough as well . Can you come more about that ? Um , yeah . That started recently like just , um , um , maybe yesterday and , um , it's , uh , it's dry for now . It's not very painful , but it's sort of there all the time . Okay . And is it worse at any particular time of the day ? Sorry . Is it worse at any particular time of the day ? For example , in the evenings . Night time mornings ? Um . Or is it throughout the day ? No , it's it's , um , it's sort of , it's sort of constant . Okay . Um , I forgot to mention that , um , I'm also having , uh , night sweats and night sweats . Okay , that's very odd , actually . And , uh , sort of makes me a bit tired , um , and makes I can imagine . Yes . And this is again been going on for the last 3 or 4 days , has it ? Yeah . Yes . Okay . Um . Right . Okay . Have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all ? Um , I , I had some , some fever in the beginning , but it's now sort of , uh , going down . I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen , okay , for that . And , uh , they they help . That's very sensible . Um . Very good . Um , in terms of your chest , otherwise , have you had any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest ? Um , so no pain in chest , but , uh , I noticed that I , um , um , so I feel a bit winded on exertion , so if I , I haven't been going going to the gym , that's , um , because of that , let me say , when did you feel , uh , do you feel more short of breath , would you say on exertion ? Okay . Um . and that's mainly on exercise . But when you're resting , there's no problems . Yeah . Yeah . When , when when I'm resting . It's okay . So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing . Okay . Just a couple of other questions if you don't mind any pain in your ears at all . Um , no . Yeah . You don't feel blocked or any discharge coming at you is . I don't think so . Okay , fine . Um , what I'm gonna do , I'm just gonna run through a few , uh . Yes . No questions , if you don't mind . Just a review of your systems . Any . Any headaches at all ? Um , yeah . Yeah , that that's still that's still there . Whereabouts are the headaches ? Um , just sort of general , um , and , um , they're not they're not always there , but , you know , every now and then they would come and go . Okay . And we're just headaches . Have you had any problems with your eyesight , your vision ? Um , no . Any difficulty with seeing bright lights ? No , I don't think so . No . Okay . Um , and just moving down now in terms of any any feeling of nausea or vomiting , I understand . Okay . Tell me about your bowels . Your bowels working . Okay . Um , yeah . Yeah , I think so . Passing urine . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . How's your appetite , sir ? Yeah . I've been I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual , but , uh , so . But other than that . Okay . Um . And you're eating and drinking . Are you eating okay , otherwise . Um , maybe a bit less than , uh , than what I would usually have . Okay . Um , have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin ? Um . No , no . And any general muscle pain or aches , joint pains or muscle pains ? Yeah . Yeah , that's that's sort of started in the past couple of days . Yeah . Okay . All right . Um , and , uh , just have a look at the rest of your history . Are you otherwise fit and well , or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of ? Um , so otherwise that I'm fine . There's , um , there isn't anything that I'm taking or I'm being treated for . Okay . Um , so you're otherwise fit and , well , uh , any any allergies at all to any medications I should be aware of ? Um , no , no , no . Okay . Um , any family history at all . So anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of ? Anything like diabetes , high blood pressure ? Um , yeah . My grandma has diabetes . Um , your brother and my grandma . Do you say grandma ? Sorry . My apologies . Grandma . Okay . Um , do you know what type of diabetes it is ? Is it type one or type two ? Okay , um , anything else which you think is significant ? Yeah . I think , um , one of my , uh , great granddad's had an eczema . Excellent . Okay . Okay . Um , just moving on to what we say . So , social history , just to get to know you a bit more as a person . Tell me , who do you live with at home ? Oh , I live alone . Okay . And you said you work at the moment , is that right ? Yeah , yeah . What do you do for work ? Um . Um . I'm an accountant . Okay . And how's your work going at the moment ? Over the last . Has it has it been affecting your work ? Um , a little bit . I've been a bit slower , and , you know , it's it's it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year . Mm . Okay . Is that stress ? Is that affecting your , um , your mood at all in any way ? Um , no , I think I think it's , it's the , you know , it's the good kind of stress . It's okay . It's good work . If there's anything you ever want to talk to me about , you can also come and see me about your mood and stress and stress anxiety . We're happy to help . I like my job . It's just , you know , it's a bit more work than usual . Okay . And just very briefly , in terms of smoking , do you smoke at all ? Um , yeah . Occasionally . No . Cigars and things on company parties . Okay . So not not regular . Um , and what about alcohol ? Um , occasionally I would have some , um . I'm not a very big drinker . Again , socially with work . Um , okay . Um , so , um , so just having listened to your story , um , uh , really , just to summarize , the last four days , you've been feeling generally quite unwell . Sore throat , runny nose , a bit of a dry cough , a bit of muscle pain , weakness . Um , had an initial fever , but now settled . Um , I don't think there's a lot to worry about . I think you probably have , you know , a bit of a viral what we say , viral illness or maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection , or maybe early signs of a flu . Um , these normally lasts for about 7 to 10 days and just gets better really over time . But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest . I'll probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can . Um , making yourself , you know , pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated . Continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen . Um , and we should see how things go . Really ? Um , if next week is still not better , I'd like you to come back and see me . Um , is that clear ? Is that does that make . Does that make ? Yeah . Yeah . That's that's that's all good . It makes sense , I think . I think I'll take a couple of days off . Yeah . And see how it goes and things to look out for if you're really not getting better , if you if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more laboured or chest pain , I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner . Give me a call . Um , and we can help you out , okay ? Yeah . Understood . I'll , uh . I'll take care . Great . Have a great day . Good luck with your work . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Bye bye . Bye bye .
