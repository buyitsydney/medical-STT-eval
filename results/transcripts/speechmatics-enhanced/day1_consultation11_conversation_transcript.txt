Hello , hello , hello , hello , can you hear me ? Okay , I can hear you , but I can't really see you . That's perfect . Um . Is that okay ? Am I meant to just connection on the screen ? It's audio . No , no , it's absolutely fine . Um , now , before I go any further , can I confirm your name and your age ? Um , so , um , my name is , uh , Dan Chowdhury . I am 727 . 27 . Okay . And how can I help you to solve tahnoon ? Dan . Um , so I've just , um , been having some troubles , basically in the . It was , uh , I guess it's been a little while now , and I've just been feeling not so great , and it's all come from like , uh , it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out , like loads of it . Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it . Yeah , it doesn't feel very solid . So it just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like , just coming out and it's , uh . Yeah . It's just , uh , not not being very pleasant and like , I just it just kind of hasn't , doesn't feel like it's getting better , so . Well , no . Sorry to hear that . Seems like there's a lot going on there . Well , when did it all start your symptoms ? Um , so I think it was a few when I think about it . So Monday , Tuesday I saw I think it was about three . It's been about three days now . Okay . And is it mainly diarrhea . So you mentioned watery stools . Um , how many times are you going a day would you say ? Um , so I , I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake . Um , right . Okay . So you're not you're losing a lot of fluid there . Yeah . So I mean , I'm , I'm trying to drink a lot of water , but , um . Yeah , it's just quite a lot . And , uh , it's . Yeah , I think I feel like it's just . Just fluids coming out . Okay . Have you noticed any blood in your stools ? Um , so I know I don't I don't remember anything , like . No , I think it's just nothing like that . There's nothing like that . And any any tummy pain . Any any any pain in your tummy . Yeah . I mean , I , I feel I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go . Right . So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go . So yeah , I mean that's that's the kind of the first sign . Where is this crampy pain ? Which part of your tummy ? It's kind of I so when I , if I think about it , it's like it's like at the bottom . I don't know if that makes sense . Um , well , why don't we start with . Is it , is it in the middle or is it to one particular side ? Um , I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me . Not on any side , left or right . Okay . And does this pain come and go , or is it there constantly ? Um , it it comes and goes . It comes and goes . Fine . Okay . And if I were to ask you , on a scale of 1 to 10 , ten being the worst pain you've ever had , how bad is this pain ? Okay . So , like , um . So what do you mean by pain ? So I think it's maybe . Is is this pain that's making you double over ? Is ten is it ten out of ten the worst pain you've ever had , or is it more of a kind of a mild pain ? Like a three out of ten ? I guess so . Um , when I think about it , like when I get it , I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and I can still , like , cover it up and people don't really notice , so I , I don't know what that means , but maybe is that like a six or a seven ? Six actually . Okay . All right . Good . Um , and apart from the pain and diarrhea . Any other symptoms like nausea , vomiting ? Um , yeah , I definitely I definitely feel kind of nauseous . Um , like and like I've have vomited . And when I like , I think it's maybe something to do with , like whenever I have , like , milk or something like that , I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like , yeah , one time I just , like , had some milk and I just vomited it . Okay . All right . I've been trying to avoid it , but , um . Yeah , the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea . Is that right ? Um , sorry . Could you repeat that ? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea . Is that right ? Um , no . No . It's not . Okay . Okay . All right . Um , any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures ? Um . So , yeah , I think I'm pretty . I feel kind of really hot all the time , and , um , I'm pretty sure I'm burning up . I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that , but it's I . Yeah , I've I've . Okay . Sure . I'm , I'm not uh , like , not a normal temperature . Okay . So you're feeling hot . Okay . And in terms of your waterworks , are you passing urine ? Okay . Um , yeah , but I guess less frequently , maybe . Um , but it seems to be okay . Okay . All right . Um , fine . And you said mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off . Are you aware of any triggers ? I mean , have you , for example , gone out , had some takeaway food ? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea , for example ? Um , so I know so my , um , my brother has had actually had something like this for , um , he has it as well for five days as well . Um , and I , I , I'm not . Yeah . I can't think of what , what the trigger is for me . I mean , my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me , but yeah , I that's why your brother now better , um , he . So he's been like this for five days . I think he's getting better , but I'm not . I'm not really sure . He said . He said he had . He's had something for a little while as well . Okay . All right . Are you having anything to eat or drink ? I can see you're drinking your coffee , but are you keeping it down ? Are you keeping your fluids down ? Um , so it just feels like , um , the fluids do go down , but it just feels like it's going straight through . It just feels like it's going straight through . Okay . All right . Fine . When was the last time you had anything solid to eat ? Uh , which which which you kept in . Um . So I had some . I mean , I had some lunch today . Um , but again , it just it just came come out pretty loose . Okay . All right . Um , and Dan , moving forward , are you otherwise fit and well , or do you have any other medical history ? Um , so I , um . Yeah , I think I think otherwise I'm fit and , well , I , um . Yeah , I mean , I , I'm an okay weight and , um , I can't think of any related medical history . Um , I mean , like , my . Yeah , I know , I don't think so . I'll take it . You don't take any regular medications then . So I , um . No , I mean , I I've been taking some , like , paracetamol and stuff like that lately , but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that . Okay . And do you have any allergies to any medications ? Um , so I don't have any allergies that I know of . Okay . And what about any family history ? Do you have any family history of bowel problems ? Um , with bowel , like , is the colon like something ? Yeah . So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really anything from the mouth ? So my . Yeah , my , my dad actually has , um , colon cancer at the moment . Oh , dear . I'm very sorry to hear that . How is he ? So , um , from what I heard , he's kind of . So I don't I don't speak to him that often , so I don't I don't know the exact details , and I don't exactly know the full things of , like , the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing . But , um , he's sort of in his third stage . Uh , I'm not sure what that means , exactly . Um , yeah . Okay . Yeah . So , uh . Yeah , it's it's , um . He's . Yeah . You can I can see he's kind of weaker , and it's affecting him a lot . And , um , that's so he's quite . I guess he's , um , had it for a little while now . Well , I'll make a note of that , because , uh , it's important to know these kind of details , um , and socially . Tell me more about your home situation . Who's at home with you , Dan ? Um , so , uh , not my brother . He doesn't live with me . I'm . I live with my , um , sister and my mum . Okay . And , uh , how are things at home ? Um , in what sense do you mean that in general , day to day life . Are you managing okay ? Any particular challenges ? I mean , uh , I think , uh , yeah , it's been it's been tricky . Um , going to work with all of this ? Um , I dislike , um , taking time off work . I feel like I just want to go , um , when I can . So I try and go , um , I think at home . Um , yeah , I just I haven't really , um . I don't normally actually , um , eat with my family . I normally I'm buying stuff and that kind of thing , so I don't think it's affected them . And I haven't really been I haven't really gone into detail with my sister or my mum about it . Um , yeah . I'd just rather deal with these things . Um , so what you mentioned , you mentioned work . What is it you do for work ? Um , so I work at a , I work at , um , an office , um , in central London . Um , it's , uh , so I work in government . Government . Okay . So . Okay . Right . There's a couple of last , final couple of questions , uh , smoking and alcohol do you do either ? Do you smoke or do you drink much alcohol ? Um , so I , I smoke , um , I smoke uh uh , for like socially , but not like regularly . Um , so normally if it's a Friday or something like that , I might , I might have a cigarette or something like that , but , um . Sorry . And the alcohol . So alcohol . Um , I , you know , I might have a beer during the weekdays maybe . Uh , not that many . Maybe . Um , but on Fridays I have more , um , alcohol . Um , but , yeah , a lot more units , um , on it , I suppose . Um , not every week , but maybe once or twice a month . But , yeah , I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's , um . Yeah , that's very helpful to know . So , um , Dan , just as a conclusion , um , just to wrap it all up , I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis . Okay . A bit of a basically an infection of your tummy , of your gut . It's nothing to worry about . I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days , just like it did for your brother . Make sure you drink plenty of fluids . Okay . Um , you can just drink like normal water . I just feel like every time I drink , it's just coming out . Um , fluid is probably best , but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins . Um , so you can get things like dioralyte , which is , um , a fluid replacement , which you can get from the pharmacy . It's probably worth recommending that . Do I need a prescription for that ? No . You can just get that over the counter . Okay . Um , you can try just , you know , regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish . But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days . So 48 hours , I want you to give me a call back because , um , you know , if you are getting dehydrated , then we need to do further investigations . Okay . But I think let's let's see how you are the next 1 to 2 days . Okay . And , uh , we'll catch up soon . Okay . Okay . So you're saying that I should I could , uh , I'll try and buy this dioralyte . What what should I do in terms of , um , food and that kind of thing ? Should I just focus on fluids ? Food is all . Yeah , absolutely . Clear fluids . You can use soft diet things like soup , mash , and then gradually build up , um , as much as your body can tolerate . Um , but really , let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first . Okay . Okay . Is it okay for me to carry on having , like , um , paracetamol and things like that ? Absolutely . If you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain , if you're feeling feverish , then paracetamol is very sensible . Okay . Okay . Try and avoid alcohol if you can . Uh , okay . I'll try . Yeah . Okay . All right then . Okay . Thank you for your help . All right . Thank you very much . Thanks for helping me out . Bye . Bye now . Okay .
