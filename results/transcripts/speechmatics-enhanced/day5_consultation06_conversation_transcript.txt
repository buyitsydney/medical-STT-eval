I live with my brother and my mum . Okay . Okay . And , um , have you tried anything yourself for this problem ? Well , I've tried a home remedy . Um , I've tried the the or you know thing about from my my local , my local . Um , um , can you just repeat that the the the salt sugar forest . Um , um , mix the salt sugar mix . Okay . And how often have you been taking that ? I've taken that . I've taken that , like , um , three times a day for the past two days . Okay . Um , and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or . Are they ? I'm not getting any better because , like I said , I've been . I've been vomiting literally everything I take . So . So I doubt that even that has had the chance to work . Okay . Um , I mean , it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing , it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got , which is usually caused by a virus , but it can be from something you've eaten as well . Um , if the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts , um , if the symptoms are continuing to get worse . The key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough . Um , sometimes you do require certain medication to help this . If it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria , um , what I would say is probably worth , as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off . I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool , so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection , which needs specific treatment . Okay . Um , and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down , then you can get dehydrated . Um , how do I how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even drink water ? I'm throwing up everything . Yeah . So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts . It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago , so you're obviously still , um , hydrated enough to pass urine , but we , um , we should see you so that we can check your hydration and , um , get that sample sent off as soon as possible . Because if you come into the clinic , you can send that sample off straight away . Otherwise we would have to post it out to you , which would take time . Okay . So when can I come to the clinic to have this done ? Um , so we can we can make you an urgent appointment . Um , and then you can , you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration . Um , but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell , then we would get you seen urgently in A&E . Okay , so you could call us back in the meantime . Okay , so what I'll do . Yeah . If you could please book me the appointment and , um . Yeah , I'll see how I feel , um , before the end of the day . Hopefully I don't need to go to A&E . And you keep drinking , keep going with the rehydration salts . Just tiny sips constantly so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit . So just tiny , tiny sips . But just keep going with it . Um , and just have very simple food . If you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that , avoid , um , fruit , vegetables and milk , anything like that , which might just make it worse . Okay . Okay , so you'll have to book an appointment through the support line . Yes , please . Right . Okay . We'll do that for you . Okay . Take care . Thank you . Thanks . Bye .
