Sorry I didn't catch your date of birth . I'm 32 years old . 32 years old . Okay . Could you tell me the first line of your address and post code , please ? Yes . Four Park Avenue and it's Ab1 CB two . That's great . Thank you so much for that . Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment ? Yes . Okay . So how can I help you today ? You've been having some problems with your asthma , is that right ? Sorry . Say that again . How can I help you today ? So , um . I've been experiencing very weird symptoms over the past month or so , and I don't causing them . I have googled it , and , um , nothing's coming up , so I thought I'd come and speak to you about it . Okay , so tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you've been having . So it started with feeling very tired , for a couple of days , and then I get back to normal . And then I started losing feeling in my hands and arms . I get a weird sensation , like , I guess pins and needles , right ? And just the connection is not so great . You've been getting pins and needles in the hand , is that right ? Yeah . That's correct . Okay . Is that the right or left hand ? My right hand . Is it always the right ? Yes . Okay . Um , we've lost video now . Maybe . Is there a button you can press ? Okay . Are you happy for us to carry on without the video ? I can't see you at the moment . Yes . That's fine . All right . Um , so you've been having these pins and needles episodes of numbness in the right hand . Is it just the hand , or does it go up the arm as well ? Uh , the pins and needles are in the hand , but I feel like my arm is getting weaker . But it only lasts a few days and then goes back to normal , so it's very weird . It , right ? Okay . Is there any involvement of your leg at all ? Uh , my colleague said I'm walking slightly differently to normal . And again , it's only for three days or 3 or 4 days . Okay . You said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month . Yes . So what has been happening from the beginning of the month ? What else has been happening ? I generally feel tired and weak , and sometimes I feel nauseous and I don't feel like I want to do anything . Right . Okay . Um . And , um . You know , your colleague said you've not been walking normally . Yes . Do you feel anything different on either side in terms of your legs ? Have you noticed anything different ? Yes . So at the same time , I get my arm symptoms , my leg feels weaker . Right . Okay . And , you know , the abnormal gait . Has that been present outside of these episodes ? No , it has not . So normally I'm fit and well , actually . All right . Okay . Um . And these these episodes , how often have they been happening ? They have been getting more regular . So at the start , it would be maybe once a week to every once , once a month , but now it's getting , uh , a couple of times a day . Right . Okay . And how long have these episodes been going on for ? When when did it all start ? Probably one and a half , maybe two months . Right . Okay . Okay . And along with these symptoms of the weakness and numbness , do you have any other symptoms at the same time , like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems ? So recently I've noticed I can't hold my cup of coffee , and when I do drink coffee , it's slightly harder to drink . And that's only been in the last couple of days , I guess . Right . Is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes ? Only during the episodes . Okay . Do you have any difficulties swallowing at all ? Not currently . No . During the episodes , do you have any difficulty swallowing ? I feel like there's something in my throat . Okay . What about difficulty speaking during these episodes ? Any issues with that at all ? No , I can speak . Fine . Okay . Any visual problems during these episodes ? I don't think so . But I wear glasses . Okay . All right . Now , can I just ask has is there any history of stroke or mini strokes in your family ? Uh , yes . My father has had a operation to the side of his neck to reduce the risk of stroke . Right . Okay . Um , and , uh , how about yourself ? Have you had any history of mini strokes or anything like that along those lines ? I know you're quite young . No . So after my dad had his operation , I was required to be checked , and my cholesterol was fine . Good . Excellent . So you had a blood test done ? And did they check for diabetes as well ? They checked my diabetes , my blood pressure and my cholesterol . And the doctor said it was all okay . Fantastic . Okay . Now , do you have any other illnesses at all ? No . No . Are you on any medication ? I take an aspirin 75mg once a day . But that's because of something I read on the internet . Okay . So ? So why is that ? Why do you take that ? I think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack . Okay . Have you ever told a doctor before your GP that you're on aspirin ? Yes . I took I started taking it after my father had his operation . But that wasn't the doctor telling me . Okay . And has any GP ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin and whether you should be on it , or have you not told the GP in the past ? No , I haven't . You haven't . Okay . Um . All right . Um , now , um , in terms of your , uh , your kind of social situation . Um , are you working at the moment ? Yes , I am . What do you work as ? Uh , I'm actually a doctor . You're a medical doctor ? Yes . Okay . Uh , which specialty are you in ? I work in a plastic surgery . Plastic surgery ? Okay , great . And , um , do you have any allergies to any medication at all ? I'm allergic to penicillin only . Okay . And , um , are you , um , living alone ? No , I live with my wife . Okay . Um , fantastic . Do you smoke at all ? No , I don't . Right . Okay . Um . That's fine . Now , obviously you're a medic yourself . Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on ? Uh , I've absolutely got no idea . Right . Okay . Um , well , the way you're describing these episodes , they make me concerned about mini strokes or Tia transient ischemic attacks . Um , and so that's something quite urgent . And given that you've got a family history of , um , stroke , um , even though you're quite young , I think , um , it's something that we need to exclude . So what I'm probably going to do , and in fact , what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a stroke Tia clinic . Um , now , just to double check . Do you have the symptoms right now ? No , I'm perfectly fine at the moment . Okay , so . So what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a mini stroke clinic or a Tia clinic . Um , I send that referral off now and then . You can attend them . They'll usually call you in within the next 1 to 2 days . Okay . Because it's something relatively urgent . Now , today it's Wednesday . So we've got a few days before the weekend . So , um , um , basically the deadline should be Thursday . Friday . We're expecting you to be seen by that time . That's the kind of turnaround we're looking at . And in that clinic , they'll be doing a number of things . Um , they'll be checking . They'll be doing the ultrasound of the carotid arteries like your father had . Um . And they'll be doing . Maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to check if there's any signs of a bleed there . But , um , they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have , um , any illness . So you haven't got any kind of stroke or mini stroke . Now , if your symptoms return and they persist , they're prolonged , then , um , you may need to attend A&E . Okay . Because , um , a presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or Tia . Okay . And if a mini stroke is prolonged , then then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke . And in that case , that becomes even more of an emergency . So we're not talking about waiting 1 or 2 days . We want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible . Okay . Now , if things happen again , feel free to contact us . We can assess you over the phone . We can give you direction and guidance over the phone . That's that's that's not a problem . You know , you've got easy access to us . Okay , so , um , this is the plan going forward . Um , I'm going to , um , do that referral . You should hear back from the hospital talk relatively soon . The hospital . You can actually ring them on . Um , the pals number . And then there's also the clinic number . I'm going to need that number in the notes for this consultation . Okay . So you'll have all the information you need to chase this appointment . And , um , if you want , you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning . Today in the afternoon . Wait 1 or 2 hours or tomorrow morning just to find out when they're planning to slot you in , and just to make sure they've got you in the system , that they've got the books and they're going to be calling you in . Okay , great . Um , this isn't an immediate emergency that you need to rush to , but it's something quite urgent that we need to deal with in a short space of time . Okay , so if there's if there's any delay that transpires , for example , you can't make the appointment or you know , that you don't get called . Something needs to be done . You need to get in contact back with us . Okay , great . All right . Did you have any questions at all ? No . I think that covers most of it . Okay , great . So just bear with me a few minutes , and then I'll send that all through . And then you should you should be able to have you should have the information at your hands in order to take things further . Okay . Great . Thank you . All the best . Take care . Bye bye .
