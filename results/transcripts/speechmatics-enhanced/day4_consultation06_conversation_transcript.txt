And I'm getting really concerned , especially because I'm having , like , these , uh , changes in the vision . Okay . So it started this morning . Was it a sudden onset headache . Did it come on suddenly . Yeah yeah yeah . Okay . And did it come on really bad or did it start off , uh , like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache ? Uh , it came , like , kind of suddenly . And if ten is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life , how bad would you say the pain was between 1 and 10 ? Well , I had a kidney stone , so let's say that that's ten . Um , I have now maybe five . Well , six . Six , probably six out of ten . But it's not about me being really concerned because this is very weird . Okay . No . That's fine . Have you ever had a headache before ? Sorry . Have you ever had a headache like this in the past ? Um , well . Not really . Yeah . Like this ? No , definitely . It's something new . Okay , okay . If you had to say where across the head . The headache is , is it across the front ? Around the back . It's in one side . The left side only . And tell me , what visual problems are you getting ? My vision is quite blurred . Um , it it's it's really weird . Like some zig zag lines . Okay . Kind of . I don't know how to describe it properly . Okay . And , um , have you tried any painkillers for this already ? Yeah , I tried paracetamol , but it didn't work . To be honest , I feel exactly the same . Okay . Um , okay . Um , what time did you take the paracetamol ? How long ago was it you taken it ? Uh , well , uh , the the headache started like four years , four hours ago . So I would say , like , maybe three hours ago because I couldn't stand it . Okay . Um , and your visual problems is still ongoing now . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . I feel a little bit a little bit . I cannot stand screens . Um , but . Yeah , definitely . And when I move , like , the thing is that if I . If I leave bed , I start to feel like , even worse if I move . So I just want to have my head . My head , like , really not moving . Okay . Okay . Um , so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or , like you want to vomit ? Oh , yeah . Oh , I forgot to mention definitely . I vomit twice , actually . As soon as the the headache started , I also vomited . So initially I thought it was something that I ate . But then the headache started to be really bad , and I still feel nauseous . So I'm about to vomit very soon , I think . All right . Okay . You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones . Any other medical problems ? Sorry . You've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones . Have you had any other medical problems in the past ? Uh , so , uh , not actually , uh , my mother has migraines . I'm not sure if that's relevant . And also , I have hyperthyroidism in the family , so it might be I don't know , I don't know . What else do you have in the family ? I think we are losing connection . Sorry . I think we lost connection . Oh . Can you still hear me ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can hear me . Um , you said you mentioned your mother has migraines . What else do you have in the family ? Hyperthyroidism . Hyperthyroidism . She has hyperthyroidism . Okay , fine . Okay . Um . And no other relevant family history . Uh , no , not that I'm aware . And do you take any regular medications ? Uh , no . Are you allergic to any medications ? Not that I'm aware . Uh , yeah . Not that I'm aware . Okay . Is there any chance you could be pregnant ? Uh , I really doubt it . Fine . And you're not allergic to any medications ? Fine . From . And what were you thinking might be going on ? I know you seem quite worried about it . Was there anything in particular you were worried about ? Well , I'm a little bit hypochondriac , so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor . Tumor or something . Because I'm like , this is really the pain is so horrible that or maybe a stroke . I don't know , it's it's just like , you know , you hear so many stories that you definitely start to wonder if I should go to A&E urgently because I might really have something serious . Okay . Okay , fine . Um , now , just another question . Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs ? Anything like that ? No no no no . And when you're walking , you're able to walk fine in a straight line . Or is your your walk ? Are you walking a bit funny ? Uh . Not really . Okay . It's really about the head . That's why I find it very weird . Okay . So just just to clarify what you said this morning , you woke up , and then later on in the morning , about four hours ago , you've developed a headache . Um , mainly on the left side of the head . Yeah . Left side of the head . Behind the eye . Sorry . Is it behind the eye ? Is that where the pain is ? Uh , no . No , it's , uh . I don't know how to describe it , but it's just like , um . Kind of . Okay . That's fine . You've noticed that your vision is blurry . There's funny lines . You feel a bit nauseous . You vomited twice . Um , yes . And you're feeling dizzy as well . But you're you've got no neurological symptoms . You're walking fine . Um , and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped . Is that okay ? Yeah . So it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine . Is that something you've heard of before ? Uh , no , it's the first time . Okay . But I'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it , so . Uh , well . But I never had it . And I thought that the onset of migraine will be , you know , in much , uh , early ages . So that's why I'm not sure if migraine makes sense . Okay , so , um , usually with migraines , they can present at different times in people's lives . So sometimes they can present as a child . Sometimes they can present when they're older . Um , and sometimes they can present , you know , even postmenopausally . So there's different there's different ways you can get migraines . Um , and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head , which is typical of a migraine . You've got blurry vision again , which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting . That's also typical of a migraine . Now , Um , the obviously if the headache is really severe and I'll suggest some medications you can try . If that doesn't work , we would want to see you as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well . Oh that's great . To make sure that , you know , there's , you know , when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine . Um , I would recommend , in the time between now and when we can see you , it can take some medications , maybe something like ibuprofen . Okay , so and you're saying that if this is a migraine and if I try that medication , this should go away kind of today . So yes a migraine . Yeah . Not you know , even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes , depending on what your response to it is . For some people , uh , whatever medications they take , the migraine doesn't improve . And it can last from anywhere from 4 hours to 72 hours . Migraines can last . Um , but . Oh , okay . That doesn't sound good . No . So there's lots of medication treatment so that it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness . So which you can get from the pharmacy . Um , and also to drink a sugary , um , carbonated drink , something like Coke . Okay . So the three of them is a is a good sort of cocktail to start them . Then we can go up the treatment ladder . You can get specific migraleve medication , and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the to do the assessment . Okay . Sounds good . Assessment where we could see you today at some point . Okay . Um , but however if you do take these medications and you know , by the time your appointment time comes and you feel much better in yourself , you can cancel it and you can give us a call and cancel it . Okay . Sounds good . Yeah . Sounds a good plan . Any questions for me ? Uh , no . Thank you very much . You were very helpful . All right . Okay . Um , any further problems between now and your appointment ? Please do let us know . Okay . Yeah . Thank you very much . Okay . Bye bye . Disconnect .
