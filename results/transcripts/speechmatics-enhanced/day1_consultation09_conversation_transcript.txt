Uh , I do drink , like , on the weekends . Yeah . So socially . Okay . All right . Um . Right . Excellent . So , um , at this stage , I'll proceed to examination . But based on your story , um , just to summarize , really , it's the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain on passing urine , a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down , um , essentially . But no other fevers or back pain . Uh , if I understand correctly , I probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection , a bladder infection , um , which can be readily treated . So I can give you a course of antibiotics today , something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim . Uh , and it's normally a three day course , so one tablet twice a day for three days . And that should help your symptoms . But I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids . Let's try and flush that . You know that infection out of your body . If you can , um , you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms . Um , and if you're still not better by the end of this week , I want you to give me a call or come back and see me , And we can have another look at your symptoms . Okay . So three days of the medication and then wait a little bit . If it still doesn't go away , call back . Yeah absolutely . And things to look out for would be you know if you are having kind of high temperatures , back pain , um , just generally feeling more unwell . Uh , you know , I do call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys , which is something we want to avoid . So do give me a call if you have any concerns . Okay . Okay . Is there is there anything like , like should I be worried about , like like not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this ? I mean , if you can try and avoid it , I think that'd be sensible . Um , it is great at using barrier contraception . I recommend you to continue using barrier contraception , but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up , that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend . Okay . Okay . All right . That makes sense . Great . Okay . Thank you so much . Very much . Wish you all the best . Yeah . Thank you . Take care .
