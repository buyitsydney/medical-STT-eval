Thank you for that . Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak ? I am , yes . Okay , great . So how can I help you today ? Um , so I kind of woke up this morning . Um , and I've just got this really horrible pain on the left side of my head . Um , a real kind of headachy feeling . Sure . Okay . And , um . Uh , did did the pain wake you up ? Yeah , it woke me up , um , quite early this morning . What time did it wake you up ? Um , probably around 530 ish . And what time do you normally get up ? Um , I normally get up at about 7:00 . Is the headache still present now ? Yes it is okay . Have you had this kind of pain before ? Um . I mean , I've had a bit of a history with headaches , but nothing as severe as this before . So there were less severe . Were they similar in nature in terms of being one sided and the type of pain ? Um , not so much . On the one side , it tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head , in a way . Um , but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side , which I've never really had . Is normally they're kind of spread across the front of my head . Okay . All right . And , um , can I just double check ? Do you have any neck stiffness at all ? Uh , no . Okay . And do you have any fever ? No . All right . Um , how are you with bright lights at the moment ? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights , or can you tolerate them ? Okay . Um , I'm a little bit sensitive . It just . It kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore , but nothing that I can't really handle . Okay . And can I just double check ? Um , are you feeling nauseous at all ? Um . Not really . Like , when I first got up this morning . My head felt a bit dizzy , but that's kind of subsided now and I seems to be fine . Okay . Um , and , um , can I just double check ? Does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that ? Have they been diagnosed with migraines ? Uh , no . They haven't . Okay . Um , and , um , are you under any particular stress at the moment ? Um , work's kind of , um , a bit stressful at the moment . I've got a lot going on . Um , yeah , I just seem to have , like , a lot of , kind of a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment . So I've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well . Right . Okay . Um , and , um , how long has that been the case for ? Uh , probably about a couple of months now . Um , how would you say your mood is ? Um . I'm not , like , moody . I'm not angry or , um , like , I get a bit frustrated during the day . Um , but it kind of ebbs and flows every now and then , but . Yeah . Okay . Do you have have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past ? Um , I've had um , so I had like anxiety for about two years now , and I've been on sertraline for a while . Okay . Are you taking searching at the moment ? Yes . Okay . Um , and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment ? Do you feel anxious at the moment ? No , not necessarily at work . Sometimes I do feel a bit anxious . Um , I kind of just the panic of not being able to get my work done on time . Um , um , but other than that , I don't feel , um , massively anxious . Okay . All right . Um , now , sorry to ask this . Just need to ask this for anyone suffering from anxiety . Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself ? No . Um , now , with regards to this headache , is it worse when you lie down or , um , is it better when you lie down ? Um , when I lay down , like , uh , it kind of feels a little bit sore at first . Um , and it takes me a while to get comfortable . Um , so yeah , at the beginning it does . But then again , that just kind of , um , soothes a little bit . Okay . Um , so would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down or do you not ? Yeah , I would say so . Okay . Um , and , um , in terms of , um , this headache since this morning , have you taken anything for it yet ? Um , I've taken some paracetamol . Does that help ? Um . Not really . No . Okay . Taking anything else at all ? No . That's it . Just paracetamol . Okay . Um , do you have any other illnesses at all ? Uh , none . Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure ? No . Have you ever had your blood pressure checked ? No . Okay . Um . And are there any illnesses in your family ? Um , no . There's nothing . My parents , uh , my mum's had a history of anxiety as well , but no , kind of , like , physical illnesses or anything like that . Okay . All right . And , um , are you on any medication ? Um . No other other than sertraline . And having taken , um , paracetamol this morning . Um . Nothing else . Do you have any allergies to any medication ? Not that I'm aware of . No . All right . And are you living by yourself at the moment or are you living with someone else ? Um . I live with my partner . Okay . Are you a smoker ? No . Okay . And , uh , do you have any pets at home ? Uh , I have a cat . Okay . And can I just double check ? How much exercise would you do ? Normally a week . Um , so normally I try to go running at least three times a week . Okay . And what's your diet like ? Um . It's okay . Um . It's nothing . Nothing . Um . Really healthy . Um . But it's fine . Okay . Unhealthy . All right . Um , now , um , in terms of this headache , um , obviously I haven't been able to examine you or see you directly , but , um , it sounds like it might be one of two things . It could be an element of what we call tension headache . Okay , that's one possibility . Um , and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past . Okay . Um , the other possibility is , um , migraine as well . Okay . Um , and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light . Okay . So what what I think we can do is , um , I think we can give you some , um , generic pain relief . That would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches . Okay . So I'll tell you in a second . And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look , explore things to try and decrease the stress from work . So . Okay . Um , the medication wise , the things that we start off first line , if someone had migraine was would be to start ibuprofen and . Okay , uh , the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen . So that's one thing we can start . You can keep on taking paracetamol as well , if you like , but the but my preference is actually more effective for migraine and . Oh , right . Um , yeah . So the guidelines have changed recently . Before that we used to give paracetamol as first line , but now it's ibuprofen or aspirin . That's okay . Um , the other thing I'd like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work . Okay . Because if it's due to stress from work , um , maybe having a week off , if you self-certify , that might help with things . And I'd also like you to explore counselling options as well . So there's counselling service in your area that I can give you the link for , for you to self-refer . Yeah , that'd be great . Okay . Let's try that . Um , what we're going to do is we'll have a follow up in a week's time , as well as those two things . Other things I'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven , eight hours sleep at night . Every night . Okay . A minimum of 1.5 to 2l of water or fluids a day . And that's not including coffee or tea . Okay . All right . Because sometimes dehydration and fatigue can be causes of headaches as well . Um . Oh , I didn't realise that . Yeah . So that is , um , you know , we need to rule those things out . Um , let's let's try that . Okay . Um , let's have a follow up appointment . If we're finding that things are not getting better , we might need to arrange some blood tests or , um , look at other possibilities , but we'll try that in the first instance . Um , if anything changes in the meantime , or you get worried or things get worse , feel free . Have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation . Okay . Yeah , that sounds brilliant . Thank you so much for your help . Okay . No problem . So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes . Um , and I'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes . If you can read through that in your own time , that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you . Contacting another doctor . Okay . That's perfect . Thank you so much for your help . No problem . Okay , so we'll touch base in a week's time with me , myself or one of the other doctors , and we'll take it from there , okay ? Okay . Thank you . Yeah , I'll book an appointment . Um , yeah , in that time . Brilliant . Okay , then . All right . Take care then . Thank you . Angie . Bye . Bye bye .
