Okay , before we start your appointment , could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth ? Yes . Uh , my name is John Smith , and I was born on the 5th of April , 1973 . Okay . That's great . Thank you for that . Um , are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely ? Yes . Okay , great . Okay , so , um , tell me a bit about what's been happening . You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow . Yeah . Um , I just noticed this , like , about a week ago or something . Um , have , like , a weird swelling on , on on my elbow . I noticed that when I was in the shower . Um , it's not painful at all . Or , like , I feel fine , but it's just . It's just a bit . A bit weird to see that , um , it's it's slightly warm . Um . And I kind of feel like this . It's a bit fluid inside or . Um . Sure , sure . So I would like to know what's going on , basically . And so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow ? Um , it's the the left elbow . Left elbow . Okay . And have you banged that elbow ? Did you have any kind of injury ? No . Not really . Um , not that I know of . I haven't noticed anything . I can actually like it normally . Um , it's just I can just see that it feels a bit strange . Sure . Okay . And , um , in terms of your job , do you do anything physical ? Not really . No , I just , you know , sit at the desk . Um , right . Yeah . Okay . And , um , has this happened before ? No , no , I haven't noticed that before . Um , I don't have any , like , history of of seeing this , I don't remember , so . Okay . And can I , um , can I just double check ? Has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that ? Um , well I do . Well , I think I think I have something like osteoarthritis . Um . Uh , it's sometimes kind of hurts my joints , but , uh , in my family , I'm not sure . Okay . So . Sure . So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis . Has anyone ever told you that ? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis ? Um , yes . Yes . A few years ago . Okay . Was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist , a GP ? Um . GP okay . All right . Um , can I just . Sorry . Can I just double check how old you are , please ? I'm 53 . 53 . Okay . Fantastic . All right . Um , and do you have any other illnesses at all ? Um , well , not not you know , um , I'm allergic to peanuts . Um , but that's pretty much all I have to say about my medical . Ah , yeah . Are you allergic to any medication ? Uh , no , not that I know of . Sure . And , um , do you , um , are you on any medication on a regular basis ? Uh , no . No . Okay . And you normally fit and , well , mobile , active . I do , I do do some sports . I run regularly , like , 2 or 3 times a week . Um , yeah . No , I'm . I think I'm healthy . Okay , good , good . Well done . That's good that you're doing that on a regular basis . Okay . Um , and , um , uh , can I is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now ? Uh , yes . Sure . Okay , bear with me one second . Right . Okay . And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that , a bit higher , so I can just see the underside . Okay . Fantastic . All right . And then just bring it around to this side , essentially . I can see the other side . Okay . Fantastic . All right . And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers , there's . Is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin ? The adjacent skin . It's a bit warm . Yes . It's a bit warmer . Okay . Um . And , um , is it very tender when you're pressing on that ? Now ? If you give it a press . Does it hurt you at all on the . On the tip of the elbow ? It's . It's okay . Just like next to it . Like where the the swelling is . It's a bit . Yeah . It feels a bit fluid . Okay . All right . Um , well , um , I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow . Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body ? Uh , no . Not really , I have skin . Do you suffer from eczema at all ? No . No . All right . Okay . So , um , what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem . Okay , is , um . I think it would be worthwhile . This seems like , uh , what we call the bursitis . Okay . So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint . Um , what I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance . And as well as that , what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling . Okay . So , um , what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some , um , blood test forms to be sent out to your house , and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done . And that will involve you , um , having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers , infection , rheumatological antibodies . So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well . Okay . Okay . The time frame for that will be , um , the results will come back to us after about 5 or 6 days . Um , from now , it takes time for the forms to come out to you . And if you get the test done straight away , by the time that we're expecting a result back , you know , 1 or 2 days after that , we're looking at maybe six days . And what I would suggest is we can arrange a follow up appointment for you in one of our clinics , where we can have a look at your joint , feel it , we can review the blood tests and we can , um , get a gauge as to , uh , what's going on now in terms of your joint right now , it doesn't look like to me like something called , excuse me , septic arthritis . So we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint . Um , and your joint doesn't look like that . However , if your the elbow was to become very red , very painful , uh , and the redness was to spread or become , you know , more intense , then you need to get on the phone or have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible , because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment , more immediate treatment . Okay . Do you think it's something dangerous , like something like , could I die from that or is it . No , I don't think this is anything dangerous . I don't need to worry . Okay . What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop . Okay . So if things were to worsen . This is not the case right now . Right now , it looks quite straightforward . There's nothing sinister or life threatening . Um , what I'm doing is . I'm just saying , in case things worsen , these are the things that we'll be looking out for . And this is what you have to do . But you don't have that now , thankfully . And I don't think you're going to have it , but I'm just saying the what if scenario . Is that okay ? Yeah , that sounds good . Thank you . All right . Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me ? Um . Well , just . Yeah , I just wanted to know about this . Um . Yeah . It feels a bit better now to know that . Okay . All right , that's it . Thank you . Okay , so I would take ibuprofen regularly okay . You can get that over the counter . Um , that's 400mg two times a day . And you should take that after food . Not on an empty stomach . If you get any heartburn , stop taking it . Okay ? Sure . All right , so what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you . And , um , we are going to arrange a follow up appointment , maybe within a , um . Actually , you know , the appointment doesn't have to be face to face if it's more convenient for you to do it over the phone . We can do that over the phone , over video . We can do that as well . That's your call . But you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then , okay ? Okay . Yeah , that sounds good . I will do that . And if I see that it's getting worse , I'll probably ask for a physical appointment . But sure , sure , that's a good idea . All right then . Okay . Um , take care then . So I'll just leave that with me . I'll sort all those bits and pieces out , and then we'll get them sent out to you , and then we'll we'll review you after the test if things go well . Thank you . All right . All right . Take care . All the best . Bye bye bye .
