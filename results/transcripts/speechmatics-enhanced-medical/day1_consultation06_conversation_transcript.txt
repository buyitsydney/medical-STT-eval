Um , I kind of normally I can walk to the shops without a problem , but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath , and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house . And it's got me kind of worried . Don't really know what's going on . Okay , okay . Is there anything you're particularly worried about ? Um , well , I've , uh , I've got , um , heart failure .

I just called it something like that . A small heart attack . A small heart attack . Okay . Was it like angina or . Um . Um . I know they they said they it seemed it was , like , more than angina . Okay . Um , uh , but , um , I didn't , but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days . Okay . Um . And . Yeah , I've been okay since then . You've been okay since then . Okay . All right . So apart from the , uh , the heart , the heart problems , the heart failure , any other problems I should be aware of ? Uh , no , I think I'm otherwise . I'm okay . Okay . Um , do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics ? Are you taking . Do you know which ones ? Uh , yeah . I take something called frusemide . Which dose you're taking ? I can't remember . I'm sorry , doctor , I'd have to check . No problems . Um , any other medications ? Uh , yeah , I take aspirin . Okay . And all that metoprolol , was it or . Um , the connection is not very good . Okay . Thank you . Yep . Um . Uh . Simvastatin . Simvastatin . Okay . All right . Any allergies at all to any medications ? Uh , no . No allergies . Okay . Is there anything in the family that's that's , uh , that's important for me to know ? Any family history of medical problems ? Heart problems , lung problems . Uh , my my father died of a of a heart attack . I'm sorry to hear that . And , um , how old was your father when you passed away ? Uh . he was , um , early 60s . Early 60s . Okay . Uh , anything else I should be aware of ? Um , my mother had osteoporosis . Okay . Your mother still with us ? Uh , yeah . She's still living . Okay . All right . Um . And socially , sir , just tell me a bit more about your situation at home . Who lives at home with you ? Uh , I live on my own . I got two cats . You got two cats ? Okay , great . Do they have names ? They're my family . Uh , they're called , um . They're called Holly and Tim . Okay . Um , so it's just you and your cats , and , um , in terms of day to day , are you working at the moment ? Uh , I work part time as a , uh , lorry driver . Okay . And how is that ? Is that quite stressful . Long hours . Uh . It's okay . Um , I , uh , yeah , like , when I'm working . It's pretty exhausting . Um , I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick , I won't . If I get more sick , then I won't be able to work properly . Yeah , it's certainly a consideration , isn't it ? So let's let's try and get better soon so it doesn't have any , um , impact on your on your job . And do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours that you do a lot of night driving . Weekend driving . Oh , no . I only take shifts during the day . I don't like working at night . Okay . All right . And what about smoking and alcohol ? Because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems . So do you smoke at all ? Not anymore . So you used to smoke ? Yeah . And how many did you smoke a day , on average ? Oh , it's about about a pack a day . Back in the day . Um . And how many , how many years was that for ? Oh , that was a good 25 years . Okay , well done for stopping . It must be very difficult for you , but well done for stopping . Um , and what about alcohol ? I don't drink alcohol . Okay . Do you do much in the way of exercise , sir ? Uh , I try and walk to the shops at least once a day . Okay . Um , okay . But , uh , that's about it . I've . Yeah , I don't I don't go running like I used to when I was young . Right . Okay . And certainly now with your symptoms , you said you're feeling more breathless , even walking to the store , to the shops . You said , um . Right . So , um , based on your based on your history and having listened to your story , I wonder whether you've had a bit of a flare up of your heart failure , sir . Um , which can sometimes happen , um , um , and , you know , it's what's going on . So it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be . Um , and obviously , having diagnosed with heart failure , there's obviously , um , the first thing that comes to my mind . Um , now there's a couple of options to move forward . Um , given that you're otherwise well , at the moment and having examined you , your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay , I'm quite happy to increase your dose of frusemide . So maybe rather than one tablet a day , we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days . Um , and see and see how you're getting on . Okay . I think that would be best . I think it's it's definitely worth treating your symptoms . But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests , like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping . Okay . Is that something you've had ? Yeah . So , um , an echo scan ? It's a scan of your heart . You may have had this done before when you were diagnosed . And it's just to get a good now . Sorry . Yeah , I remember now . Okay , fine . That's something I can organise for you today . And it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organised , but I think certainly in the meantime , let's , um , let's let's get a blood test done . We can check your , um , you know , your full blood count , look for signs of anemia . We can have a check your kidney function . Um , and we can definitely increase your , um , your frozen mind , uh , to , you know , one tablet twice a day . But I really would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time to see how you're getting on . Does that sound reasonable ? I think that sounds like a good plan . And , of course , in the meantime , if you are getting more unwell . So if you're feeling more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness , then I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well . Okay , I'll see how I get on . Okay . Do you have any questions for me ? Uh , I think that's all pretty clear . Thank you very much , doctor . Great . Now I wish you all the best . Have a good day . See you soon . Okay . Thank you .
