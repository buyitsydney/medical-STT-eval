Hello . Hello . Hi , I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon . How are you doing ? I'm okay . Thank you . Um , not feeling that great , actually . All right . I can't see your face properly . Just . Yeah . That's it . That's good . Thank you . So I'm sorry to hear that , but just before we start , is it all right ? If you could confirm your name for me , please . I'm Mary Jane Gray . Um , date of birth ? Date of birth ? Um , 1980 . Okay . And your address for me , please . Um , I live on SW four zero and G . That's correct . And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation . Yeah . Okay , so you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy . Is it in your notes ? Yes . Yeah , I'm feeling I'm . Yeah . I'm just feeling very sick . It's probably because I'm feeling dizzy . Um , my room is sort of spinning , um , and I , I can't , I can't walk properly . Well , I can walk properly , but not straight . Um , and my ears are buzzing a bit . I'm just feeling a bit off . Okay . Yes . Buzzing . So when did it all start ? Started probably about two hours ago . Maybe . But I , um , I had it a similar sort of thing about a month ago . Um , but I didn't really think anything of it because it settled quite quickly . Um , but this has been going for a bit more now . Okay . So you you mentioned it started a few hours ago . So how did it start ? What were you doing ? Um , I was actually making my husband some breakfast , um , and I . Yeah , I just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy . Um , and a bit shaky . Okay , so it's like the room spinning around . Yeah . Okay . And is how long does it last for ? Or is it that now . Continuously . Now . Yeah . It's there the whole time . So it's there now for the past two hours you'd say . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Did you have any kind of viral illness in the recent past ? Past couple of weeks ? No . No . Cold cough ? Nothing . No . I've been pretty healthy , I think . Um , yeah . Yeah . Okay . Um , you've mentioned that you have some year buzzing kind of thing . Any kind of year pain or year discharge , anything like that ? No , nothing . Okay . Do you have a temperature at all ? I don't think so . Um , okay . Right . You also mentioned that you can walk , but you're not walking straight . Why is that ? Is it because I think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit ? Um . It feels like the room . So that's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady ? Yeah . My my legs and arms and everything are working fine . I just I don't feel like I'm stable . My . The room is spinning , so there's no weakness of your arms and legs . Okay . No . Okay . Right . Um , so you mentioned you had something like this a month ago . So how how how long did that episode last for ? Probably only about five , ten minutes . Okay . Right . And do you have any problems hearing at the moment ? Like , is it muffled or something ? It's just a bit of a buzzing noise in my ears , but otherwise I can hear everything . Okay . Right . You okay ? So have you been physically sick ? No , but I am feeling very sick . Nausea ? Okay . Right here . And I don't have much information of your past medical history . So is there any medical conditions you'd like to tell me ? Surgical . Medical conditions ? Um , I've had premature ovarian failure . Um , and I've taken HRT . Okay . HRT and premature ovarian failure . Okay . And , um , any other medications at all ? No . Okay . Do you have any allergies at all ? No . Okay . Right . Okay . So talking to you today , um , in the the most common , um , you know , diagnosis we would say you are suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis . Yeah . Okay . That's when your middle ear . There is some , um , some inflammation going on there , and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear . Okay . So what ? The most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear sedative so that you won't feel as if you're going around in a boat kind of feeling . Okay , so that's what we need to start , because to actually make you able to function a bit more , we'll start you on certain medications . I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure . So this is like just symptomatic relief . Like if you have a fever we just give paracetamol . So just to , you know , make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that . While you're with the doctors , we'd like to do your blood pressure . Just examine your , you know , you know how you're walking and everything is okay while we are waiting , while you're waiting on seeing the doctor , if you develop any weakness of your legs or arms or or , you know , a sudden headache , any of those symptoms , or you start being violently sick with it , then you know you would need to take yourself to A&E . Okay ? But if not , wait for the appointment for the doctor to examine you . Um , and we'll take it from there . So I'll send the prescription across to your pharmacy . It looks like it's the Lloyds pharmacy on our system . Is that correct ? Yes . Yeah . So we'll send you across that prescription . Um , it's called Stemetil . Yep . It's one tablet three times a day , so I'll give you about ten days worth in the interim . Obviously , in the next few days , you'll get to see one of our doctors , and we'll have to just take it from there . Okay . Thank you so much . Any questions at all ? Um , can you take do you need to take those tablets with food , or can you just take them anytime ? It doesn't really matter . You can take it because sometimes , you know , you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up . So probably you feel a bit sick to eat anything , so might as well just take the tablets . Okay . That's great . Thank you so much . That's so helpful . Just make sure you call support to book that appointment , okay I will . Thank you very much . Bye bye now . Bye bye .
