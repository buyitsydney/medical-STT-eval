Hello ? Hello ? Can you hear me ? Uh , yes , I think it's a bit better . It's a bit . It's a bit . It's not very clear , but let's continue anyway . Okay . Okay , let's start again . So how can I help you , sir ? Yes . So it's been a few days now . I have , like , a sore and a red skin . It's kind of . It's really itchy and it's , like , super annoying . So I'd like to find something quick to solve it . No . No problem . I'm happy to help . Um , whereabouts in your skin is it affected ? Um , mostly like my chest . My my hands , my arms . Like . Like , really ? It's . It's super annoying . Like , it's itching a lot , like , all the time . And I can't even sleep at night . Like , I really need something quickly to to solve it , because even at work , I like , um , when I'm in a meeting and I have to , like , think about my work and focus , like , actually focus on my work . It's really annoying because I can't actually think about what I have to say . I'm always like , uh , disturbed by this disease . No , no . Okay . And this is obviously affecting you , and we'll try our very best to get it sorted out for you . Um , have you had anything like this before in the past ? Um , so , yes . Uh , earlier I was , like , prescribed for my eczema . Okay . And they gave me , like , some cream and something to , uh , when I like , was shower . When I was in the shower , I had to put something . Okay . But , um , did it help ? Um , I mean , at that time . Yes , but the symptoms like these symptoms are like when the symptoms appeared again , I tried those , and it didn't work . I've tried a few things . Like I bought , like , a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night , but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today . Okay . Uh , yeah . Do you remember the name of the cream you bought ? Uh . Steroid cream ? Okay . Steroid . Okay . That's okay . Um , do you would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different . Uh , it's much more like itchy . And my eczema was more like only in the arms . And now it's also on the chest and in the and the on the hands as well . Okay . Yeah . When like , I like , for instance , hiking during the weekends and I , I can't really do it anymore because it's like very like like I wanted to do that last weekend and it was super painful . And I have to take like , showers every day to be able to kind of , uh , ease this itching part , which is very , very annoying . No . Well , okay , so you mentioned the itchiness and you also mentioned it's been quite sore . Um , have you , have you noticed any , uh , bleeding or discharge from your skin ? No . No . Um , so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts , like , kind of cracked , if you see what I mean . Okay . But , uh , yeah . You haven't seen any other , uh , pus or blood coming out of your skin . No . No . And you mentioned it all started three days ago . Four days . Four days ago . Are you aware of any triggers or anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start . So for example , have you changed your shower gel ? Any clothing ? Have you been around anyone else ? No . It's actually like it's very annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something because I haven't and I don't understand . And I'm kind of , um , afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of , you know , I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions . It's kind of intimate . And so I need your help now . Mm . No , no . Okay . That's okay . Um , fine . So just to summarize , for the last four days , you've had very itchy skin , very sore skin all over your body , mainly your chest . And did you also mention your arms and legs as well ? Um , no , just the chest , hands and like , like inside the elbows . Okay . Anything on your face at all ? My what ? On your face . Oh , on my face . No , no . Okay . And apart from this , any other symptoms have you noticed ? For example , have you noticed any temperature or fevers ? No . Just itching . Itching . Nothing else . Okay , so your bowels are working . Okay . Your chest is okay . No cough , no breathing difficulties ? No . You're passing urine . Okay ? Uh , I think so . Okay . All right . Um , it's always good to know . So . I mean , do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms ? Any what ? Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms ? Um , so I had eczema before , so maybe it's this , but it seems like more , uh , like , uh , my eczema was only on the arm , so I'm not sure . I really have no idea . Okay . No . That's okay . So , um , normally at this stage , I'd like to examine you , um , to see the rash itself and see exactly what type of rash it is . But from what you've told me , you mentioned , it's you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well . Um , and it's been very itchy . And so with your , um , uh , your background of eczema . Um , sorry . There's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you , which I completely forgot . My apologies . Um , apart from the eczema , do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of ? Uh , no . I just had asthma in the past . But not anymore . Not anymore . Okay . And do you take any regular medications at the moment ? Uh , no . No . Okay . Do you have any allergies to anything ? Sorry . Yeah . Sorry . Any allergies to anything ? Hello ? Hello ? Yes . Can you hear me ? Oh , sorry . I think it cracked . Um , do you have any allergies at all ? Oh , allergies ? Uh , no . No . Okay . Um , and tell me about your , um , your situation at home . Who do you live with ? Um , so I live with a few flatmates . Um , so , you know , I'm 31 . Uh , I . Yeah , I have a full time job and so I'm living with a few people to save money . Okay . And what do you do for work ? Uh , I work at a pharmaceutical company . So it's been a it's been a few years now . Uh , it's , uh , it's kind of interesting . We're working . I'm a , like , a kind of project manager . Uh , I mean , do you want to to know more about it ? Okay . Uh , no . No , no , that's absolutely that's absolutely fine . Um , just a couple of questions I want to ask you , which can sometimes affect your symptoms . Is do you smoke at all ? No . No . And do you drink much in the way of alcohol ? Uh , you know , once in a while I can . I like hanging out with people once in a while . So . Yeah , I'd say a few . A few beers per week . Something like this . Nothing . Nothing crazy . I used to drink a lot more when I was younger , but it's been . It's been a while . Okay . Okay . I would say at this stage , I've got to say the sound quality is not great , but I will continue because we've come this far . Um , so , um , based on everything you mentioned , sir , I do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema . Um , the reason being that you said it's quite itchy . Um , it's mainly affecting your chest and your back . Um , and , uh , having looked at your skin , the rash does appear quite familiar . Um , you mentioned you're using steroid creams yesterday . Um , from the pharmacy . I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial . Um , which I'm happy to prescribe to you today , as well as I'm going to give you something , some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin , um , which I use in the bath and shower . And it's definitely worth , um , using that for the first 7 to 10 days . Um , before we make a decision on whether it's working or not . Um , it's also worth , um , using antihistamines , which you can sometimes buy over the counter , things like loratadine or piriton , which can help with itchiness of your skin . And , uh , um , it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms . Anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap . Because if that's causing your symptoms , then we need to have a discussion about that next time I see you . Okay , just I have tried anti-histamines , uh , lately , but it didn't really help . Oh , could you say that again ? Sorry . I have tried the antihistamines . Okay . Uh , but it didn't really help . It didn't ? Okay , so something for you to think about . You can get different type of antihistamines . I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well . Um , something like fexofenadine , which I can give to you today . It's definitely worth trying it . It's not going to do you any harm . Um , but I certainly think using the steroids and the emollients , um , on a regular basis , um , over the next week to ten days , should hopefully control your symptoms . But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better . That sounds good . Okay . Um , do you have any questions for me ? Uh , no . That's it . Okay . Well , I wish you all the best . Thank you very much . Thank you . Have a good day . Bye . Thank you . Bye .
