Hello ? Hello ? Can you hear me ? Yeah I can . Can you hear me ? Hi , my name is Doctor Gausche-hill . I'm . Hi . I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon . Are you in a quiet and private space to talk ? Well , I am , yes . Good . And can I confirm your name and date of birth , please ? Uh , it's Joe Bloggs . It's the 7th of June , 1974 . 74 . And how old does that make you ? Sorry . 54 . Perfect . I'm supposedly 53 , but . Yeah . Great . And it says here , um , it says you're having chest discomfort . Is that correct ? That is correct . Yes . I'm experiencing some discomfort in my chest . Okay . Can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment ? Sure . Um , it's been ongoing for a couple of hours now . Um , I'll say this quite suddenly . I was digging in the garden . And if I had to describe where it is , it's somewhere in the middle of my chest . And it's more . It feels more like a pressure . The discomfort them more than the pain . Um . If I had to . Oh , if I had to describe what that discomfort feeling is , it's like someone sitting on my chest . Okay . And . Yeah . Great . So you've talked about your chest . Are you still in discomfort at the moment ? Uh , yes , as we speak . Okay . And when it started , how would you rate it out of ten ? Okay . About a seven out of ten . Okay . Can be very sort of unbearable pain . Seven is quite manageable , but it's quite uncomfortable . Okay . And how about now ? Um , it's still the same . Okay . And tell me before this happened . What were you doing ? Um , I was relaxing . My wife and we're watching Jeremy Kyle . Okay , so go out into the garden . Okay . And how often do you do gardening ? Um , every other week . So fortnightly . Okay . And are you normally fit and . Well , so are you normally okay to garden as you would . Uh , yes . Great . And apart from this , do you have any other medical problems ? Um . High cholesterol . Um , and have had hypertension or have hypertension ? Okay , so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol . Do you take any medications for that ? No , I don't take any medicine okay . And are you allergic to anything ? Uh , aspirin . Okay . So let me summarize what you've told me already . You were gardening a few hours ago , and you experienced chest discomfort , which was roughly seven out of ten . Yes , it feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain . Yes . That's great . And apart from this , have you noticed anything else unusual , specifically with your breathing ? Uh , yes , I have . Um , I've got shortness of breath , and I feel slightly lightheaded . Okay . And is that getting worse or better ? Um , it's remained the same . Although I would say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing , I've had some difficulty climbing stairs . And if I have to sort of walk uphill , there's that sort of challenge as well . And when you get short of breath , when you're walking up the stairs , have you noticed any pain ? Um , no pain as such , but there's often calf pain and leg swelling . Okay , so let me confirm . You have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath . Is that correct ? That is correct . Yes . So given what you've told me about your past medical history , I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance . Okay . Get you to the hospital as soon as possible . Because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart . So while I talk to you , I will ring an ambulance . Who should come to your address ? You're right . But in the meantime , I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics . Is that okay ? Um . Should I be concerned about anything ? It's nothing to worry about at the moment , but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain , I'm always worried about the heart first before anything else . Okay . And we need to look after your heart before anything else . So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort , have you noticed anything else unusual ? Um , nothing else unusual . Um , I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea . I've noticed nausea , but no vomiting . Yeah . Do you have anything to eat or drink this morning ? Um , no . And you feel still feel nauseous at the moment ? I have , yeah , I am , yes . So I have a couple of other questions to ask you , and I'm going to reel them off . So apologies for not letting you talk very much . No that's fine . Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head ? Uh , no , not to my head , no . And how about your left or right arm ? Uh , yes . There is some pain in my left shoulder and arm . And does that pain go anywhere else to your left arm or to your back ? Uh , no . And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water ? Uh , no . Good . And have you noticed any problems going to the loo ? Uh , no problems going to the loo . And you're normally fit and . Well , apart from the two things you told me about . Um , yes . However , there are some problems just performing daily activities . Um , like I said , with the difficulties climbing upstairs and going uphill , um , I tried to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house . Nothing too strenuous . And do you live at home with your wife at the moment ? Uh , yes . Okay . I would suggest if she's there , you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today . So she might need to get your things together . Got it . Okay . The ambulance should be there very soon . In the meantime , I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to . Don't take any of those medications . Okay . The paramedics should be with you very shortly . Right . So when they do come , there are two things they will be worried about . Okay , the one is your chest . So your heart . And the second is your breathing which is your lungs . Okay . So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate . So don't be worried , okay ? And when you get to the hospital , you'll be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately . Yeah , that sounds reassuring . Thanks for that . Sure . So I will let the paramedics do their job . And when you're at the hospital , the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going . Oh . That's great . Great . I'll book another appointment to see you soon . Okay . Once you've had your adventure . It's perfect . Thank you so much . No problems . Do you have any questions for me ? No questions . I'll just wait . The ambulance . Great . Thank you very much . No problem . I'll speak to you soon . Thank you so much . Bye . Okay .
