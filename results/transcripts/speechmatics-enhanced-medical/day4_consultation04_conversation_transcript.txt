Hi . Hi . Hi . How are you ? Uh , yeah , I'm all right . Thanks . Um , well , I'm actually feeling a little bit wheezy . Okay . My name is Doctor Gauthier , and one of the herbs that work on . Can I confirm your name and date of birth , please ? Uh , yeah . My name is , um , Tina Smith , and I'm 40 years old . Okay . And are you in a space that's quiet and private ? Uh , yeah . Yeah , I'm just in my room . And you mentioned that you're wheezy . Mhm . Can you tell me a little bit more about that ? Yeah . So , um , it started like about two days ago . Um , I don't know if it's because , you know , I was like , cleaning the house and like , um , all this dust came out of the carpet . And , you know , I've always thought that maybe you've got an allergy to , like , dust , um , or something . So I don't know if it was triggered by . Um , you know , two days later , it's still not gone any better . So , um , just getting a little bit worried about it now . Okay , so you were cleaning the house two days ago , and that's when it first started . Uh , yeah . That's right . Did the wheezing start suddenly , or was it gradual ? Uh , so it started after maybe an hour or so . And has it got worse over the past two days ? Yeah . So it gets a bit worse at night , I find . Okay . And have you taken anything for the wheeze ? Uh , no . No , I haven't actually . Okay , so . And the wheeze has been getting worse . And today you're particularly worried , is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it harder to talk ? Yeah , yeah , a bit of both , actually . So , um , I'm feeling like a little bit , uh , short of breath . Okay . Um , and actually , when I'm , you know , talking to my friends and stuff , finding that , uh , sometimes I'm unable to complete my sentences . Okay . It can get really bad . Yeah , and when you can breathe and you take a deep breath . Do you notice any pain ? Um . No , no . No pain . Okay . And have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal ? Uh , no . No dizziness ? None of that . Okay . And have you been eating and drinking ? Okay . Particularly water . Yeah . Yeah . I think I'm having , like , you know , 4 or 5 glasses a day . Yeah . Okay . And are you normally fit and well , or do you have any other medical problems ? Um , well , actually , I used to have , like , a bit of , um , asthma , uh , as a child . Um , and also in the summer , I sometimes get , um , hay fever . And when you get hay fever , do you take medications for it ? Uh . Not really . Okay . And your asthma , did it resolve when you were a child ? Uh , I think mostly , yeah . I mean , sometimes when I , um , run for , like , long periods , it can . It can start up a bit , but , um , I have a , I have , like , an asthma inhaler use for that . Okay . So do you still have your inhalers ? Um , I think I might have one from , like , a couple of months ago . Okay . Um , but you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma ? No , I don't . Okay . And apart from this , do you know if you're allergic to anything ? Uh , not that I know of . Okay . And how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment ? Sorry . Could you repeat that ? How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment ? Um , they may be minutes drive away . Okay , good . So , given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer . Your shortness of breath high . I've lost video signal . Can you still hear me ? Um , yeah . We've just turned off . Perfect . So , given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever , this could be one of two things . But we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first . So what you'd need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests . Such as ? Okay . What sort of . So the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood . Okay . And from that , we can tell if it's asthma or something else . Right . Okay . Before this happens , if you've got something like an Anti-histamine , which you normally take for hay fever at home , I would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust . Okay . Yeah . I don't have any anti-histamines at home , Unfortunately , you might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery . If not , they can prescribe you one . Okay . Okay , so I can just get it over the counter then . Yes . And they're normally about 4 to £6 . Great . Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about or want to ask me ? Um . Um . Not really . I mean , I have before taken steroids for asthma . Um , I don't know if that's relevant . Yes . That is . And you may need to take some steroids now , but we cannot we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first . Okay . Okay , cool . So I'm going to write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened . And the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long . All right . How long do you think it will take ? Probably ten minutes . Okay . That's great . Cool . Um , you should get the letter over the app , and then we can . You can take yourself to the GP . All right . Cool . Thank you very much . Okay , bye . Okay . Thank you . Bye bye . Bye bye .
