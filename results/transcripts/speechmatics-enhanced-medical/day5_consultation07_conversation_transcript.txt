Needing to be under a blanket , that sort of thing . Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer ? Uh , no , I haven't . Okay . Um . And are you eating and drinking normally ? Uh , yes . Um , kind of around when it started , I had some diarrhea , but I don't know if that was associated , but since then , it's all been pretty fine .

And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment . Normally , no . I've got hypertension , so I'm on some drugs for that . Um , but that's it . Really ? Okay . Um , any other medical problems ? Uh , just the hypertension and diabetes . Okay . And what type of drugs are you on ? Uh , I think something called metformin . Uh , and lisinopril , I think is the other one . Okay . When did you last have your blood pressure checked ? Uh oh . Uh , a while ago . Um , do you know , do you know if it's been stable ? Uh , I can't remember . Okay . And with your blood . With your diabetes . Have you had a blood test recently ? Um , yeah . Like . Yeah , it was normal . It was around three weeks ago . Okay .

Uh , my partner and my dog . And do you work ? Uh , yes . I'm an office manager . Okay . And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms ? Anything that you've bought in the chemist ? Um . Uh , quite a few lemsips . Um , they seemed to be helping . What do you mean by quite a few ? How many in a day do you normally take ? Uh , maybe 2 or 3 . Maybe . Like at the start of the day and at the end of the day . Okay . Have you noticed any improvement in that ? Yeah . It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep . Okay . Um , do you have any allergies to anything ? Uh , I sometimes suffer from some , like , hay fever . Um , but it's not too bad yet . Any allergies to any medications at all ? Not that I'm aware of . No . Okay . So what you've described to me , it sounds like you . You probably have got an infection in the chest . Um , because it's , you know , you're obviously getting the symptoms of from your nose and your chest . Um , it sounds like you might have a high temperature , so it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature . Okay . I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something . Yeah . Um , most of the time , these infections are caused by viruses , so they do normally settle by themselves . But it can take , you know , a week or two , um , and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that . Um , the important thing to do would be to take your temperature . Um , and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 37.5 38 , um , you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your cough is getting worse . You're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm , or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out of your nose , um , or any shortness of breath , chest pain . Then we certainly would need to speak to you again . With the diabetes , you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have diabetes . So it's something that we do need to be careful of . Okay . So then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time perhaps . Yeah . Potentially if it is if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing , getting worse . And we definitely need to talk to you again . Okay . Um , have you got any other questions ? Um , no , that's all fine . It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the Lemsip . I wouldn't take and that's that contains paracetamol . So don't take any other paracetamol containing products . Um , with that , at the same time , um , the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime as best for your body if you just keep coughing . But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all , then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down . Okay , cool . Okay . Do you have blood sugar checking equipment ? Do you check ? Not at home ? No . Okay , well , if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure check ups that your GP has , uh , asked you for . Yep . Okay , great . All right , then , take care . Thanks very much . Bye .
