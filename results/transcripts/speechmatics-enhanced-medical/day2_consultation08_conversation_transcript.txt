Um , and , um , so you , you're having periods of when you're feeling hot and also periods when you're feeling cold as well . Yes . Yeah . It's quite interchangeable . It's not really a pattern to it . Okay . Uh , and have you been taking any medication ? Uh , I've been trying to , like , take ibuprofen and paracetamol just from over the counter , but it's not really helping . Just been taking the recommended dose every day of those . And when you say it's not helping , is it ? Bring the temperature down at all ? Perhaps slightly , yes . But I'm still experiencing these symptoms , so it does take the edge off of it . Okay . All right . And can I just double check . Have you got any cough or cold or sore throat , runny nose anything like that . Um , not those sort of symptoms , really . Which symptoms are you getting ? Other than the ones you've already mentioned to me ? Um , so I have , I have a that it's mainly just the sweating really . And the and the nausea , uh , that's overtaking all day and the , the aching muscles all over . Sure . Have you had any ear pain at all ? Um , no . My ears are fine . Actually , I haven't had any problems with my ears . Okay . Um , just . I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body . So I'm going to go to some kind of systemic questions .

Okay , so you know your normal headache . Where is that ? In the back of the head or the front of the head ? Um , it's quite centralized over . Over the head . Okay . And how long have you been having that for ? It's something that I've struggled with for years , really , just related to a screen use or , um , like changes in weather patterns . Yeah . High pressure days . Sometimes I struggle with migraines and headaches . Okay . Um , have you got any rash on your body anywhere at all ? Um , I haven't noticed any rashes . No .

I went to Vietnam . Uh , I came back four weeks ago now . Okay . Uh , and , um , uh , did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there ? I did , yes . Which one did you take ? Oh , I can't remember now off the top of my head . Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet ? I think it was daily . Okay . Um . And was it one tablet , or was there another one that you would take on top of the first one ? I think it was , uh , another one that I took on top of the first one . Okay . And what were you doing out in Vietnam ? Was it just staying in the cities or going to villages or hiking . What kind of activities were you doing ? Really ? Because we were there for a few weeks and we toured to several different parts of the country and the countryside and some cities as well . Okay . And , um , did you do any kind of were you in rivers or things like that ? Were you , you know , how adventurous were you ? Um , sorry . Could you repeat that ? I missed that . Were you going out into the rivers ? Were you going on beaches ? I mean , how adventurous was your trip ? Yes , it was quite adventurous . We were sort of trekking and cycling , uh , through farmland and , um , seeing how people lived in their day to day life and in farmland . Right . Okay . Um , thank you for sharing that with me . Now , do you have any other illnesses at all in the past ? Um . As I said , I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while , but I haven't really had any , um , major illnesses in the past I can think of . And that back pain . Have you , um . Have you seen anyone about that ? Yes . Yeah , I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that . Have they given you any kind of diagnosis at all ? Um , they've said that it's related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just bad posture . So mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and strength of the muscles in the back . All right . Um , are there any illnesses in your family at all ? Um , the main one would be , um , heart attack . My my father passed away of that . Um , how old was he when that happened ? Um , 68 , I think . Yeah . Okay . Um , are you on any medication at all ? Uh , just cerazette . Okay . Uh , do you have any allergies at all to medication ? No , I've just really . Pollen allergy . That's all I have . Okay . So hay fever ? Yes . Yeah . Just take a fever . Right ? Um , are you , um , you're working at the moment ? Uh , I am , yes . What do you work as ? I work as a nurse . Okay . All right . Um , and , um , you're up to date with all vaccinations , hepatitis B , that kind of thing . Yes , indeed . Yeah . Okay . But I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment . It's been quite difficult . Feeling so tired all the time ? Sure . Okay . Um . And are you , uh , are you a smoker at all ? No . I'm not . Okay . And do you drink much alcohol ? Um , moderate alcohol intake . I drink too much . And how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally ? I try and do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week . Okay . That's good . All right . Um , so , um , what I think we're going to need to do is we're going to need to bring you into one of our clinics . Okay . And we're going to need to arrange some blood tests as well . Okay . Um , okay . So what what I want to do is the first question that I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this , this fever and these symptoms . Because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me . There's no , um , when someone has got fever and sweats , we want to find out . Have they got chest infection ? Have they got a throat infection ? Um . And if we can't find a focus of infection , then that's something . That's an outstanding question that needs to be answered . Okay . Um , the second thing , second factor is that you've recently come from Vietnam and you've had exposure to rural areas . And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well . So , um , you're probably going to need some blood tests after you've been seen by somebody . Um , now , the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you , which is why we're going to go for the examination first . Okay . Come into one of our clinics in central London . That's one option . And then the GP there who examines . You can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be , or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you are living further out , you could actually just attend a local A&E . I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of tests I think you need in the notes for this appointment , so you could show that to them at reception . I'll be asking for something called Thick and Thin Blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like that . Technical terms . But they'll understand what I'm talking about . But , um , I don't think you can go into work , uh , until we've sorted this out . And , you know , we need to sort this out sooner rather than later . Okay ? Okay . That sounds great . Thank you so much for your help , I think , yeah , I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted . Okay , fine . So what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in and if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes , and then they'll slot you in and then we can sort things out from there . Okay . That's brilliant . Thank you very much . All right then . Okay . Take care then . All the best . Goodbye . Bye .
