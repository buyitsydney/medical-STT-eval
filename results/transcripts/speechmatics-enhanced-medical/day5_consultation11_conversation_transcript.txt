Hi . Hi there . It's Doctor Smith from Babylon . Hi . Hi . Can you confirm your name , date of birth and your home address , please ? Yes , my name is Mary Jones . Date of birth is January 1st , 1980 . And my address is , uh , 60 Sloane Avenue , London . Okay . Are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today ? Absolutely . What can I do for you ? So a couple of things . I think I may have overdone my workouts , and now my knees are hurting and they're clicking a lot , and it's starting to worry me . Um , I can't run very far , um , anymore without just feeling pain in my knees . And then sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes . Um , so . Yeah , that's that's it . I'm just concerned , and I figured , you know , I'd call and see if you can help me figure out what's going on . Okay . That's fine . So when do you think it started ? So probably it's been about two weeks . Okay . Um , and any joint problems before that ? You know , not not really . I mean , I play a lot of sports . Um , and I had a , like , I play some ice hockey , and I had this injury a few months ago . You know , I just , like , fell on the ice and , you know , had a huge bruise . But I think that's about it . Okay . So , um , at the moment , just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally . So I'm training . Well , I'm currently training for a marathon . Um , it's going to happen in June . And so I'm trying to run , like , I mean , right now I'm actually not even doing such long runs , maybe like 7 or 8 miles . And so I started about , uh , maybe a month ago . Uh , I've done like , you know , 4 or 5 miles and I've just done , like a couple of seven mile runs and then , uh , and then , you know , I go to the gym like , three times a week and kind of do my usual routine . Um , but yeah , I think the only thing that's really different has have been the runs , the longer runs . And have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you ? Um , well , what do you mean by that ? I'm not sure what what it means . So it means if you're if you're there and you just feel it sort of jolt like , give way , feel unstable underneath you . Not not that . I mean , it just kind of starts hurting , you know ? Um . And does it hurt ? Um , how far into the run does it generally hurt ? You know , I would say it probably starts like after , uh , maybe 20 minutes or so , which is probably , I don't know , like somewhere around mile three , maybe two and a half or three miles . Okay . Oh . You're fast . Maybe I'm switching my kilometers and miles . I'm not sure . I'm sorry . And , um , do you have to stop running , or can you run through the pain ? Yeah , that is a good question . So , um , you know , the last few times , the last time I actually stopped , I mean , I ran a little bit longer , but then I stopped because it was , um . I feel like it's getting worse . Um , and when I started doing my abs , that , you know , when I do my abs , it kind of require me to move my , you know , um , to kind of go from the flex position of my knees and straighten my legs . Then I hear all this clicking . Okay . And I think that also freaked me out . And I just figured , you know , something you said before ? It's both knees . So it's more , um , it's actually my right knee . That hurts . Um , any problems with your left one ? No . Okay . Can you just describe in the knee or show me where abouts the pain is happening ? Mainly . So , you know , I feel it . It's kind of weird . I feel it in the middle , but I almost feel like maybe it kind of , uh , um , moves to the right . To the right of my knee a little bit . Okay . Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee ? So . Yes . Well , it's . I have probably some fluid . I googled it , and , you know , it says that sometimes fluid accumulates . Okay . Does it look swollen to you ? Sorry . The knee look swollen . Um . Well , it did like the first time I ran . It was a little bit swollen , but then I just put some ice on it and it went away . Um , but right now . Right now , it's not swollen . And right now it doesn't hurt , you know ? Um , but it just kind of comes on when , uh , um , or , you know , right now , when I flex and extend my leg , it there's no clicking , but I'll notice it in the gym . And then , you know , when I run , it will start hurting . Okay . And if you're sitting still for a while , do you have any problems when you stand up ? Any locking up of the knee ? Nope . Can't straighten it . Any problems going up and down stairs ? No . Any problems just walking normally ? No , no I don't . And in terms of range of movement , are you able to fully straighten the leg ? Yes . And what about fully flex it . Yes . Okay . Are you taking any medication for the knee ? Well , um , since you're asking , um . Yes , I take ibuprofen . Um , and I'll just kind of use it sometime , like , um , like , sometimes I have some joint issues , but , you know , that kind of is not very frequent , so I'll take ibuprofen for that . But , you know , it's nothing major . Maybe like 400mg max , something like that . I also sometimes will , um , you know , smoke a joint . Um , and . Yeah , other than that , that's it . Okay . And any other joint problems that you're getting ? Any back pain ? Small swelling of your hands , feet , elbows , wrists , any pain ? Uh , well , I have sometimes . You know how sometimes , like , if you stand for a long time , your feet will kind of . Or your legs will swell up like I notice it because of my socks . I'll just kind of notice this indentation . And then another weird thing . I felt this just once , but there was this tingling in my toes , like , um , after the run , there was tingling in my toes . Like on my , you know , my right toes . Um , so on your right side , yes . Any change in color or temperature of your lower legs ? Nope . Any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it , it stays there . Well , I don't know if I really try that , but I , I will tell you that what I noticed is like , if I , you know , when my socks come off , I kind of notice that indentation a little bit . I mean , it's not like major , right ? But I , I mean , do you mean I just need to , like , press and see what happens if it , like , kind of stays or . Yeah , or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that ? No . Nothing like that . No . And and with your foot , has that gone back to normal now ? Do you feel any altered sensation , tingling , numbness and things like that ? No , it was just . It was that time . Uh , but it was just really weird because it kind of went on for a while . Okay . And any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch . Any problems walking around on hard floors ? Nope . Okay . Have you had any other medical problems before ? Uh , well , I had , uh . You know , just kind of your garden variety stuff , right ? Colds and , uh , I mean , I , I do have I'm farsighted . And so I had , I had Lasik surgery , and then once I had this really bad UTI , they thought it was kidney stones . And so they had me actually in the E.R. . And if my GP didn't call them and tell them that , you know , they don't need to give me morphine , um , that was kind of an awful experience . But , uh , other than that , you know , I'm I'm I'm pretty good . Okay . Do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about ? Well , I'll take I take vitamin D . Uh , I take melatonin sometimes , you know , just for cramps . I'll take , like , um , ibuprofen or actually a system . Uh , I'll take what am I taking a leave ? Whatever I'll leave is . I think that's maybe , um , acetaminophen or I can't remember what class of drugs . You know , occasionally , if I'm really having hard times , like , I'll . I'll sleeping . I'll take Xanax . Um , but I prefer melatonin . It's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work . Okay . And any problems with your stomach or asthma ? Indigestion ? Acid reflux . No problems . Okay . Um , what I would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using . So as much as you can , because that really does make a difference to injuries , brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better . So as much as you can use ice , um , obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon program , but , um , I would try and ease up on the running if you can . And if , if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running , then it's not a good idea to do that . Um , it's fine to take the ibuprofen . Um , I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen , but not with the ibuprofen . But make sure that with food , um , ultimately , we probably need to examine the knee . Um , so the best thing . I would suggest getting an appointment with the physiotherapist first . You can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee , and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any , um , imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage . Well , you know , I read I read some stuff online that , that maybe like my ligaments , there's I think it's like ACL or something like that . Right . And so if that I mean , I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break . So do you think it's that or , um , it's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the phone over the video . So we definitely would need to see you . Um , the physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment , but certainly the appointment times too long to wait . Then we can see . We can see you as well , can you ? So are you going to send referral for that ? Yeah , we can do referral for that . If in the meantime if you develop like persistent swelling , heat , redness um of the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it , then you'd need to see a doctor urgently . So call us back in that case . Sounds good . Thank you . Yeah , please . Sure . I mean , give me the stronger meds and I'll give that a try . Okay . I'll send it through to a pharmacy for you . Thank you so much . Bye bye bye .
