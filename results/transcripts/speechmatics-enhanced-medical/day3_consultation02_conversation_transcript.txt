And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation . We are . Yes . Okay , so I understand you're having a headache . Is that correct ? Uh , yeah . I've had a sort of a fairly sort of bad severe headache for the past four days . Um , and , um , I've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well . Um , I've got , got a bit of a temperature , I think I haven't measured it , but , um , I think I yeah , I think I've got a fever . Okay . Right . And , um , so what started for us , was it the headache or the fever ? Um , so , um , headache started , uh , first , um , and then sort of . Yeah . Fever sort of came along a bit afterwards . Okay . Afterwards . Right . And what have you taken so far for your headache ? Um . So I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen , but it's not really helping at the moment . Okay , so just a few more questions with regards to your headache . So do you find it difficult to look at the light ? Um , no . Um , like , um . It's fine . Light doesn't seem to bother me too much . Okay . And is there any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side ? If you look up and down , is there any pain ? Um , I've got sort of general aching muscles . Um , not necessarily sort of in my neck . It's kind of a bit all over , really . Okay . All over . Right . And have you been sick with this headache ? No , no , I haven't I haven't been sick . Okay . And do you have a cough ? Uh , no . No cough . Okay , so there's no cough or cold here ? Uh , no . Okay . And you . Your ears are okay . There's no earaches . Um . No , it seems to be okay . That's fine . Okay . All right . And with this headache , have you experienced any pins and needles in your face , arms and legs ? Uh , no . No . Any muscle weakness at all ? Um , just , I suppose . General aching . Body aching ? No , not any weakness where you couldn't , you know , hold a cup or anything like that . That's what I mean . Uh , no . Um , I'm sort of . Yeah , I'm fine with that sort of stuff , but . Yeah . Okay . And , um , just a few more questions . Do you ? Because I don't have any of your background history . Um , do you suffer from any medical conditions ? Uh , no . Um , general medical history is fine . Fine . And no surgical history , that no medical or surgical complaints . Yeah . Uh , no . Um , I suppose I have been away to , um , Thailand , um , a week or so ago . Um , I've had some , like , usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around . And a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell , but , um . Uh , yeah , that's the only sort of like history per se . Right . And , um , do you have any kind of shivering at all ? Do you ? Shivering with the fever ? Um , I , um , uh , I do feel cold quite a lot . Um , you know , it's , um . No shivering , but definitely , like , a bit cold . Hot and cold . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Right . And are you using . You've mentioned about the paracetamol ibuprofen now , but are you on any regular , any medication , anything that you're using at all ? Uh , no . Okay . Um , any allergies at all ? Uh , no . Um . All right . Okay . And okay , so I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you . Yeah . Um , it it's not possible for us to do that online . I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination . And I think you would need one quite urgently . Okay . So the things that's running in the back of my mind are , um , kind of a viral illnesses that can , one can get with , um , sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel like area . Um , the other common thing around Thailand , it will be like some dengue , but that would have like you would have some , uh , blood spots or bleeding or something which you don't have at the moment to you . Uh , no , I mean , I've got a bit of a rash , but nothing like , uh , no , no , no , no bleeding . Okay . So where's the rash ? Um , it's , uh , rashes kind of all over my body . Like how it's not really localized . How would you describe the rash ? Uh , uh , sort of red and itchy . Red and itchy . Okay , so if you were to put a glass on top of the rash , does that rash go away ? Uh , yes , it goes away . Okay . Okay , so what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you . And that's sometime today . Okay . And , um , after our examination , there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital , but I'm not sure as yet . So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible . Okay . Um , I'll write my notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor , preferably in the next few hours time . Okay . And , um , in any case , if that's not available , I'd like you to take yourself to A&E . Okay . All right . Any questions at all ? Uh , no . Sounds serious . It's . You know , obviously when I've spoken to you , you didn't tick the box for many series , but you're in the middle somewhere . Let's put it that way . Okay . Um , if you know , things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all , but then you just have a general muscle ache . You didn't say that . You had things like you had problems looking at the light or something . So those are things when we think of meningitis . But . And then it's the , um , in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash . While in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stages . So that's why I'd rather . But I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible if we've got a slot available . But if not , I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations . Okay . Okay , cool . Thank you very much . All right . You take care then . Bye now . Cheers . Bye bye .
