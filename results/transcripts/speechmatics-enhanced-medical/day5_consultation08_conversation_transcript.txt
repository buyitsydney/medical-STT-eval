Right . Okay . Um , and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences ? Yeah , sometimes . Okay . Um . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Okay . Um . I mean , it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma . It could be , um , triggered by if there's more pollen around , or there may be you may have a viral infection causing it to get worse . Mhm . Did you say you checked your temperature already ? Yes I checked . I have fever . Was it normal ? Yeah . Yeah . What was your temperature ? Uh 37 . Yeah . Okay . That's fine . Um , have you got an asthma inhaler at home ? Yeah . Okay . So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment . Have you got a spacer at home ? Um , do you want to show me how to do it ? Or somehow ? Um , do you have a spacer at home ? No . Okay . Um , what I can do is I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently , which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up . Yeah , sure . Um , and if you increase it . So you're taking it 2 to 4 puffs every four hours . Mhm . Initially , um , if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse , you need to call us back straight away . So we can just advise you further with that . Okay . And it would be a good idea when you're feeling better if we could arrange just a review just to see how your asthma is , because we may need to start some other medication for you . Okay . Sounds good . You can arrange a review in a week or so . Um , but but before that , if you're if you're feeling worse in a week . Right . Okay . Okay . And the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine , which you can get from the pharmacy . I can put a suggestion on your notes about what to take . Yeah . That'll be helpful . And then if you when you get the peak flow meter , if you can take the pharmacist can show you how to use it . And if you can record a value first thing when you wake up in the evening over the next week . And then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well . Oh , awesome . Thank you . Have you got any questions ? Um , no . That's fine . Yeah . Thank you very much . Thanks a lot . Bye . You take care .
