Um , I'm just really worried , like , I've just been googling and , like , I've read that , you know , if you're , you get headache gets worse when you move . It could be a sign of brain cancer . Okay . Is that what you're worried about , sir ? Is that is that what your main worry is today ? Oh , yeah . Yeah . And I've like , you know , my my friend's mum , she , she recently died of a brain tumour . So it's really concerning me actually . Oh , dear . I'm sorry to hear that . I can understand why it's affecting you ? Um , but why don't we . Why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you , and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here . Um , so you mentioned a few things . You mentioned headaches . You also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on . And your vision has been blurry as well . Is that right ? Is that is that on both eyes or just a left ? Left eye ? It feels like it's on both . Both eyes . Okay . Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all ? Yeah , well , I'm wearing . I'm wearing sunglasses right now . It's just , you know , lights really hurting my eyes . Oh , I see okay . Um , and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous . Have you vomited at all ? Yeah , I've vomited twice . Twice . Okay . And this earlier today . Okay . Um . Any temperatures or fevers ? Um , no , I don't feel feverish . Okay . Um , any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed ? I haven't noticed anything like that . Okay . Um , fine . Um . And do you normally get headaches ? Um , not really prone to them . No , no , but I did . I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago . Okay . And what happened then ? Just similar . How long did it last ? For a couple of days . Did you do anything that made it better ? Um , yeah . I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest and yeah , a couple days off work and I work in the fashion industry and , you know , they're wondering what's going on , like having to take sick days . Yeah . You need to get back to work today . But you know what ? If it is a brain tumour , what's going to happen with my future , my career , you know ? Yeah . I'm really worried about this . Never had headaches like this before . Like , why should we get now ? Yeah , sure . And I can see your concerns . Obviously , there's no worry there . Um , but , you know , let's take a step by step , um , and see exactly what the cause of these headaches are . First , I'm just going to ask you some very yes no questions . That's okay . Ma'am . Um , um , have you noticed any problems with your speech at all ? Any difficulty with words ? No . Any problems with your arms and legs , for example , numbness or weakness ? No . Any difficulty with balance ? Your balance or coordination ? No . Okay . And have you had any injuries to your head ? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head . No . Okay . All right . Um , and you're feeling otherwise okay . So for example , your , um , uh , your breathing is okay . You're not feeling breathless or , you know . Okay . Um , do you have any other medical history I should be aware of ? No , no . So , for example , have you had anyone told you you've had migraines in the past ? No , no . Okay . Do you know my mum ? My mum had had migraines , but I've not been diagnosed , right . So my next question was about family history . Is there anything in the family ? So apart from migraines , is there anything else ? Anything related to brain for example , as well ? What was that ? Sorry . My mum has an underactive thyroid as well . Underactive thyroid as well . Okay . Um , okay . Any other problems ? For example , the brain or , um , you mentioned brain cancer . Any other family history of that ? No . No . Okay . Um , in terms of medications , do you take anything on a regular basis ? Um , I take the pill . Microgynon . Okay . And how long have you been on that ? For about three months . Three months . Okay . And is that mainly for contraception , or is that for something else ? It's for contraception . Okay . All right . That's something we may need to have a discussion about today as well . Um , uh , my next question was about , um , your social your situation at home . You mentioned you work in a fashion industry and your work is your job . Quite stressful at the moment ? Yeah . It's really stressful actually having problems with like , people at work . You know , managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver . And , uh , yeah , it's not a good time . Is it getting you down ? I don't feel down . Just feel a bit stressed . Okay . All right . And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress ? Normally ? Nothing , really . Okay . Do you do much in the way of exercise ? No . No . Okay . Um , who's at home with you ? Um , I live on my own . Okay . Um , are you coping okay at the moment ? Fine . Yeah . Okay . And do you smoke at all ? No . And do you drink much in the way of alcohol ? No . Okay . All right . Um , so normally at this stage , I kind of proceed to examination . Um , but , um , based on your story , um , I wonder whether you may , um , may have a migraine . A migraine type headache . Uh . It sounds . Very classical . Or of that nature . The headache on one side . Throbbing nature , the nausea , vomiting , sensitivity to bright lights . Reassured that you don't have anything more serious , such as meningitis or indeed , brain cancer . I know that was a big worry of yours initially . Thank you . Thanks so much . I was so worried that I had cancer and now you say migraine . Yeah , I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah , it doesn't make sense . Well , I hope that you know your mind at ease . And certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month . Um , so I think moving forwards , there's a couple of options . I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches . But we should also try and treat your headaches today . So strong painkillers would be advisable . So , you know think about paracetamol or co-codamol . Um . And some anti-inflammatories , such as ibuprofen and naproxen . How does that sound to you ? Okay , that sounds good . Um , and , uh , you know , if your headaches were to become more persistent , then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place . Something . Prophylactic medicines . Okay , we can have a discussion next time . I see you . Next week , perhaps . Okay . Okay . Um , now , a couple of things I want you to think about is , you know , if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next 2 or 3 days , or indeed , you're getting worse , I'd like you to come back and see me , um , straight away , if possible . So if your headaches are getting worse and not responding to medications or your , um , neck pain is getting worse , or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision , then I'm going to come back and see me straight away . Okay ? Okay . Does that sound all okay , doctor ? That's great . Great . Any questions for me ? No . Thank you . Okay . Have a good day . Okay , thanks . Bye bye .
