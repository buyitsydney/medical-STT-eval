Because really , I , I , I'm like , I feel like I don't drink enough , like I'm , I'm drink , I'm trying to drink .

And just last couple of questions regarding your smoking and alcohol . Do you do either of those ? Uh , not really . I drink infrequently , like socially , let's say . And I don't smoke . Okay . All right . Um , fine . So , uh , Robert , um , I think having listened to your story , I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis . Okay . Which essentially is just a tummy bug . It's an infection of your your tummy , um , and normally lasts for about 3 to 5 days and gets better . All right . But things you can do to really help yourself get better soon . Um , or you can drink plenty of fluids . Really try and flush the toxins out your body . Okay . You can get things from the pharmacy which are called dioralyte , which can help replenish any , uh , minerals and vitamins you may have lost . Sorry . What's the name of that ? It's called Dioralyte . Um , it's it's a it's a type of fluid replacement drink . Um , you can take some paracetamol . If you're feeling feverish and weak , I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better . Normally , you have to be diarrhoea free for about 24 to 48 hours before you return back to work . Um , let's see how the next few days go . And if you're still not better next week , I'm going to come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms . Okay , that sounds good . That sounds good . Thanks so much . Do you have any questions for me or . Um , no , I think that's fine . Uh , yeah . I'll . I'll try to rest and drink plenty of fluid , and I hope it goes away . Uh , if it doesn't , I call , I call back , okay ? I really hope you get better soon . Thanks a lot . Thanks so much for your time . Bye bye . Okay , bye .
