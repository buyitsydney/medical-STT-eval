Has it been there all the time or is it coming and going kind of all the time ? Um , so when I take ibuprofen , it gets a bit better . So it's a bit like less , um , it bothers me less , but then I still have it . It's still there . Um , And what would you say the severity is ? If ten is the worst pain you've ever had in zero is nothing . What would you say the pain is like ? I guess it's mostly eight . And then it comes down to maybe a five . Okay . And what about at night time ? Are you able to fall asleep ? Um , yeah . I'm sleeping . Well , is it waking you up in the night time ? No , no , no , but I can wake up with it in the morning . Okay .

Um , yeah , I actually had one recently , and nothing changed in my vision . Okay . And have you had any cold symptoms ? Sore throat , sore ears , or pain over the sinuses or phlegm . Any nosebleeds or cough up ? Any blood or anything ? No . And just recently , have you been well or have you had any general problems ? Any change in your weight or tiredness , lack of energy , anything like that ? Uh , no change of weight , maybe a lack of energy , but it might be because I'm just having headaches . So I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities . But , you know , when you have this constant headache . Have you been at work recently ? Um , I work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time , so sometimes I just do the day off . So you've been you've had a headache for three days . How many days have you missed off work ? Um , so I work from home all these three days , and , um , first day I worked from home , and then , um , the second day , I just took the whole day off , and today I I just tried to work from home the first half of the day , but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus . Okay . And any other medical problems in the past ? Um , I think I only had abdominal pain , um , when I was younger , but no cause was found , and that went away . But that's the only thing I know . Okay . Have you been abroad recently at all ? No . Do you take any medications ? Um , just the pill . Which one ? Um , mercilon . And when did you start that ? Um , about a year ago . Any side effects with that ? Um , no , I don't think so . Have you noticed any any , um , increased frequency of headaches since you started that ? Um , no , because this is just very recently . So nothing , um , Nothing really changes . Okay . And when you have when you've had when you describe your headaches in the past , you said they were just general . Did you have any visual symptoms ? Flashing lights . No . Nausea . Vomiting with them ? No . Nothing . None of those . Your blood pressure . Checked recently with your pill ? Um , yeah . I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal . And when was that ? Uh , a year ago . Okay . Um . And any allergies to anything ? No . And who do you live with at home ? Sorry . Who do you live with at home ? Uh , just by myself . Okay . And do you smoke ? Uh , no . Do you drink any alcohol regularly ? Yeah . How much ? In a normal week , do you think ? Um , probably like three beers once a week . Okay . And do you take any other drugs at all ? Um , No , apart from that . And I think sometimes when the headache gets really bad , nothing else . Um , so , I mean , it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well . Yeah . But you haven't had a high temperature . Have you checked your temperature ? Uh , no , I didn't , but I don't really feel feverish or anything . Okay . Um , I mean , it it could possibly be a migraine type headache , but in fact , it's still ongoing for three days . We probably should put you into an appointment to get an examination . Um , obviously , if it settles in the meantime , then we can cancel that . But we should do a neurological examination . Look at the back of your eyes as well . Okay . Um , in terms of medication , I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen , but a bit stronger , which you can take instead of ibuprofen And you can take paracetamol at the same time . Okay , so if you're happy to book an appointment with us with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication which I prescribed , you take it with food if you're . You said that when you go to bed , your headaches okay . And not waking you up in the night time . Yeah . It's not um , but you mentioned migraine and that , um , reminded me that my mum suffers from , like , she has migraines . Okay . Um , any other family history of medical problems ? Um , no , I think that's it . But I know that my mum , like , she has quite bad migraines . She's like , has the vomiting and everything like that . Okay . That's fine . Um , I mean , if in the meantime , before your appointment , your headache is getting unbearable , getting worse or changing , then caught , um , if it's that bad , then you should go to A&E and have an examination . Um , you can call us for further advice on that . Okay . And when when you have an examination with us , we'll check your blood pressure as well , just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you . Because sometimes if we do think it's a migraine , then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that . Is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it ? Well , some say that pill . If you're having regular migraines with flashing lights or other symptoms , it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly . We'd have to change it to something else . All right . But you can carry on with that for the moment . Okay . Have you got any other questions ? Um . So would you like , um , send me a referral to a specialist or , um , or to book an appointment with the support team ? Then we can do a full examination then . Okay . Perfect . All right , then , take care . Thank you very much . Bye .
