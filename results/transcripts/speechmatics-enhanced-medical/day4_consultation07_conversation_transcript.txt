Hello ? Can you hear me ? Okay . Hey , yes I can . Can you hear me ? Yeah . Good , good . So my name is Joe . I'm a doctor , um , here at Babylon . Can I just confirm your name , please ? Hey , my name is Vincent . And your date of birth . Uh , uh , 9th of May , 2016 . Okay , great . Sorry . I know you're in a , uh , a safe place . I'm sorry . A safe and confidential place to talk and just happy to go ahead with the consultation . Yes , yes , I am . Great . So how can I help ? Yeah . So I have a cold that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week , and it's been causing me problems . I've had to stay away from work for about 3 or 4 of those days because of how bad it is . Okay . I'm sorry to hear that . So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week . And what what came first ? The sore throat came first and then after a day or two , the cough . Okay . Okay . And , uh , are you coughing up anything ? No , it's very dry . Okay . So I'm just going to ask a few questions about the your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background . Um , and something about what we can do , uh , a little bit later on in the consultation to help you . But before we go on , anything you're particularly concerned about , um , or have any ideas what might be going on ? You said that you had a cold . What ? Well , I mean , you know how we all are . Once this happens , you Google it , and there seems to be all kinds of bad things . That could be it could be it could be a cold or flu , obviously , because with tuberculosis , it could be cancer always comes up . So it'd be good if none of those . Right . So yeah , I can provide a little bit of reassurance . Um , and we can talk about those a little bit as well . And was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation ? Um , Um , well , yeah . So reassurance . So like , hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious , but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note . So if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer , I can get one . Sure , sure . Okay . All right . So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms . And I'm sure we can get a , um , those things and some reassurance , um , about your concerns . So , um , you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago . Developed into a bit of a dry cough . Um , I'll just ask a few questions around those . So , um , do you have any shortness of breath ? Yes . Yes , I've been having shortness of . Yeah , I've been having shortness of breath . Yeah . You are short of breath . And , uh , do you have any wheeze or chest pain ? Uh , yeah , a bit of both . Yeah . You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well . Yes . Okay . And how when did you start to develop the shortness of breath ? I think so . So the sore throat . So today is Friday . Sore throat was about last week . Friday or Thursday . Call for Saturday or Sunday . So so the shortness of breath was I think shortly after the cough . So maybe a day or two later . So 3 or 4 days ago 3 or 4 days ago you start to develop . And is the cough worse at night time ? No , no . It's the same throughout . The same throughout the day . Um , and , uh , when you say you're short of breath , just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are . So are you able to . So , um , so , like , walk up a flight of stairs , for example ? Um . Or are you short of breath at rest ? Uh , yeah . It's like when I'm doing walking , um , and I do exercise now and then , so it hasn't been super bad . Like , it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things , but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worrying . And you're a bit concerned about that . Okay . So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well . So , um , do you have any other medical conditions or medical history ? No . Just no . No past medical history ? No . No past medical history , no history of asthma ? No . Um , and any , uh , uh , history of , uh , clots on your legs or your lungs . So these are , uh , not many families had those clots in the legs or the lungs . Well , my mother had lung cancer . Your mother had lung cancer . Do you smoke ? No . Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos ? No , no , no . That's bestos . Ever smoked ? I mean , once or twice in Amsterdam , if that counts , but not really . Okay . Um , and , uh , this just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough . It's a dry cough . No , you're not coughing up any phlegm . Um , do do you have , uh . And you you say you don't have any chest pain as such ? Um . Uh , are you taking any medications currently ? Uh , no . I'm not . Okay . Are you allergic to any medications ? Not to any medication . I'm allergic to peanuts . Peanuts ? Okay . Um , and , uh , you mentioned that your mother had , uh , lung cancer . Um , any other family history of any significant illnesses ? Uh , running . Running in your family ? No , no , that's the only one . Just lung cancer for my mother . Just lung cancer . Okay . And you say you have a cold . So do you have sinus congestion or . Um , no . It seems to be almost entirely with just my throat . Like my nose is running . Just your just your throat . And any recent travel , or have you always lived in the UK ? Uh , no . So I , I haven't always lived in the UK like so . I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago . But in terms of recent travel just to Europe , nowhere to exotic . Okay , so no . So no recent travel , no significant recent travel anywhere . Um , okay . And are you coughing up anything other than , um , so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that ? Um , good . And , uh , are you feeling feverish ? Hot ? Cold ? Sweaty ? Yeah . So a little bit feverish . Um , at first . So the first three or so days of this . But then the fever has gone away . Okay . And in general , do you . Sorry . Yeah , yeah , I was just going to say also had a bit of a headache . Uh , like headaches that come and go rather , but , like , right now it's fine . Okay . And in general , would you say you're feeling you're beginning to to feel better , worse or sort of staying the same . So it's like it's up and down . So so let's see . So I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week . I think it was maybe Tuesday and Thursday . So like I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again . So it's been like kind of constant but constant in being variable , if that makes sense . Okay . And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors , um , that you may have . So um , no sort of significant weight loss , um , or unexplained weight loss . Any wires . So no weight loss . But I have been have been losing my appetite recently . And I mean , I usually eat a lot so I enjoy eating as well . But like so that's been a bit concerning . You've been losing your appetite recently . Yes . And you're a little bit concerned about that . But you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think of . No not that . And any um , sort of rashes or anything , uh , and , you know , rash . Okay . Um , so I would ask to examine you now , but , um , I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat , at least to see if there's probably . Oh , we can try . Oh , no . Well , no . It's okay . I might think about doing it . Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel ? Uh , no . Not really . No . Okay . Um . And so finally , you were talking about , uh , I mean , it sounds to me that , um , you've been a little bit up and down , sore throat , developed a dry cough . Um , you are slightly short of breath , but not too overly concerning . Short of breath ? What ? I would say we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is if you feel significantly worse , um , uh , if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness , um , or breathlessness that you are concerned about , and I would advise you to seek medical attention and see a GP , um , and actually see somebody physically , um , and uh , but I think for now I can sort of , uh , try and reassure you that , um , if this clears up , as I expect it would . So expect this to sort of be getting better in the next 4 or 5 days . Um , if it's not , please get in touch with the medical professional again . Um , and , uh , I would expect it to . And so therefore , I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis . Um , your concerns about lung cancer are was that the other thing you concerned about ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , yeah . So so , um , again , if you're not getting better , please see somebody again . Um , I've just got four seconds now . So nice talking to you . And have you got it ? We got to tidy up . Yeah . Okay . So , um , uh , and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work . Um , and paracetamol , lots of fluids , um , and rest up . And as I say , if you're not feeling better , please get in touch . Okay . All right . Excellent . Have a good day . Thank you . All right .
