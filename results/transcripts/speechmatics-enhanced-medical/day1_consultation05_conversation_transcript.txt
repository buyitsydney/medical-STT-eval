Hello . Good morning . Kim . Um , how can I help you this morning ? Um , so I'm having some some pain in my tummy , like the lower part of my tummy . Okay . Um . And I've just been feeling quite hot and sweaty . Right . I'm sorry to hear that . When . When did your symptoms start ? About two days ago . Okay . And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain ? Exactly . Um , like , below my belly button . It's , like , quite sore when I press on it . Okay . Did the pain come on quite suddenly , or was it more gradual ? So it hasn't been . It's more gradual . And it's just . It is getting a bit worse now . Okay . Okay . And can you describe the pain to me ? Um , it's kind of like a , I guess , a burning pain . Um , and it's just right there in that spot . Like that's mostly where I'm feeling it . It hasn't spread anywhere else . Just in just below your belly button you mentioned . Yeah . Okay . Um . And is it pain constant or does it come and go ? It's fairly constant . It's like getting worse . Um , it's not like I can still move and walk around . Uh , I mean , I'm still kind of functioning . It's just , uh , I'm aware of it all the time . Mhm . Okay . Um , and with that pain , have you noticed any other symptoms at all ? So for example let's focus firstly on your bowels . Your bowels working okay . Yeah I had a bit of constipation but that's better . Now that was like last week . Okay . So you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools . No . Um , my bowel movements are normal now . Okay . And what about your waterworks ? Are you passing urine okay ? Yeah . I'm fine . That's fine . I did notice that it was a little . The urine was a little pink in color , but I haven't , like , it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee . And , uh . And I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly , but I have been drinking lots of fluids , so I wasn't sure . Um , I wasn't sure , um , like , you know , if that was related to the pain . Can we . You mentioned pink urine . Was there any blood at all in urine , or was it difficult to say ? I can't say I mean , maybe . Okay . All right . But otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine . And I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that . Um , just that I'm peeing more than off more regularly . Okay . Um , okay . And , um , moving up to , uh , other symptoms . Have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all ? Just a little nauseous . Um , but no vomiting . No vomiting . Any temperatures or fevers , I haven't I felt a bit hot and sweaty , but I haven't really measured it , so I can't really say . Okay , fine . Um , and we have to ask , um , uh , you know , all female patients if there's questions about your cycle , if you don't mind me asking , um , are you currently , um , are you currently sexually active ? Uh , yeah . I've had the same partner I am . We were last sexually active about four days ago . Um , my last STD screen was normal , which was about six months ago . Okay , so you've had no other partners since then ? No other partners then ? Okay . Um , uh , and do you use any contraception at all ? Um , on the implanon , I had the implanon inserted about a year ago . Okay , fine . Um , are you still having periods ? Yes . When was your last period ? Um , my last period was about three weeks ago . I mean , two weeks ago . Two weeks ago . Okay . So is there any chance you could be pregnant ? I know you've got an implant in there . Is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant ? It's something for us to think about . Well , we don't use any other barrier methods , so we just use the . I just have the implanon in the same partner . Um , theoretically , if the implanon has been working , then I could be pregnant . But I don't suspect . Okay , well , something to think about . Um , maybe worth doing a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that . Um , okay . And so just to summarize so far , if you don't mind , it's really for the last couple of days , this tummy pain has really affected you , mainly lower down towards your belly button . It's quite burning . You said it's getting worse . Um , you noticed some pink urine ? Um , but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine . Your bowels are working . Okay . You felt a little bit nauseous . Um , and feeling hot and sweaty . Have I got that all right ? Yeah , that sounds very accurate . Is there anything else , perhaps , that you feel like you should share with me at this stage , which you think might be important ? I don't think so . I think we've we've covered everything that's really bothering me . Yeah . Okay . Um , tell me , tell me a bit more about your , um , medical history . Otherwise , are you normally fitting well ? Yeah , quite . Well . I haven't had any surgical . I don't have any surgical history . I don't have any previous . I haven't had any operations before or . and I'm not on any other medication . I just had the implanon . Okay . Um , anything like this before ? In the past , any similar symptoms ? I've never had . I've never had these symptoms before . No . Okay . Um . Fine . Um . Any other family history ? I should be aware of ? Anything relevant ? Family , uh , related to the bowels , maybe related to Gynae history ? No . Not that , not that I'm aware of . Okay . All right . Um , and socially , just tell me a bit more about your home situation . Who's at home with you ? Um , I live in a share house . Um , with two other . Two other roommates . Okay . Um , and , uh , are you currently working ? Yeah , I currently am currently working . What do you do for work ? I'm an accountant . Okay . Um . Great . Okay . Um , do you smoke at all ? Um , no . No . And do you drink much in the way of alcohol ? Socially , I drink , but , uh , I don't think more . More than normal . No . Okay . Okay . Um , just before I go into examination , I just want to go through just a few screening questions . That's okay . Yes or no ? Uh , we've covered majority of them already . Um , but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else . Um , how's your how's your chest ? How's your breathing ? Um , have you feel short of breath or . I'm not having any problems , or I don't have a cough or anything that's worrying me . Okay . Any , uh , funny heartbeats or rhythms ? Palpitations ? Not that . No . Okay . Any headaches ? Any problems with your vision ? No . No . Okay . All right . Um . Fine . Okay . Um . So really just , um . Moving on . Um , so basically , based on your story , really , uh , it's it's a it's a difficult one . It's , um , we know you've got some tummy pain . We don't exactly know what's causing it . It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain . Could this be a , you know , could this be a urine infection , for example ? Could this be something related to your gut ? Um , could this be something related to your , you know , a pregnancy related cause ? Um , and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out , um , what's going on here ? Um , which I can organize for you today . Okay . Um , and based on those tests , we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed . But certainly , if it's been going on for the last couple of days , um , um , you know , it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for , maybe a urine infection . Um , so with some , with some antibiotics , can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes ? Yeah , absolutely . So , um , I think it's certainly worth , you know , covering you with some antibiotics today . Um , but I still want you to bear in mind , you know , having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here . And , um , and I want you going to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better , or indeed , if they're getting worse . So things to look out for would be worsening tummy pain . Um , if you're feeling really hot and sweaty , temperatures not coming down , um , vomiting , etc. does that make sense ? Yeah , I think I'm happy with that plan . Okay . Um , you can try just regular painkillers . Paracetamol will be advisable . Um , make sure you drink plenty of fluids . You can try some cranberry juice as well , which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms . Um , take the antibiotics and give me a call if you are worried about anything else . Uh , sure . That sounds great . Thank you very much . Um , should I just collect the script at my pharmacy ? Yeah , I'll send you straight to your pharmacy . Start the antibiotics today . Something called trimethoprim . Um , will take two tablets , one tablet , twice a day for three days . Okay , that sounds great . Let's say you get on okay . Thank you very much . Great . All the best . Bye bye . Bye .
