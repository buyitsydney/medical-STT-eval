There's no delays . Hello . Hi , there . Hello there . Um , thanks for . Thanks for being here . Um , before I go any further , can I confirm your name and your age , please ? Yes . It's , um , Adriana , Catherine , Jeeva and a 26 year old . Okay . Adriana . How can I help you this afternoon ? Well , I have this , like , really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days , and it really annoys me . Oh , dear . Okay . When ? When did it exactly start this headache ? Uh , around three days ago . Maybe three days ago . Okay . And where abouts in your head is this pain ? Um , it's basically like it kind of feels all over my head , but , like , mainly , um , around my right eye . Um . Okay . Um . And is a headache there all the time , or does it come and go ? Um , it's it's kind of comes and goes . Um , but , I mean , it is there all the time , but , like , sometimes it's stronger . Okay , so it comes in fine . Okay . And if I were to ask you , on a scale of 1 to 10 , um , ten being the worst type of pain you ever had , how would you rate this headache ? Uh , it's probably a eight . Eight . And if I were to ask you to describe the headache to me , um , in terms of the nature of the pain , is it sharp ? Is it dull ? Is it crampy ? Is it throbbing ? Um , it's kind of . It's dull , but sometimes it gets a bit sharper . So basically it like it developed gradually , I guess . It's like the first day . It just started when I was at work , and by the end of the day , it was like , pretty , pretty like it was a lot , basically . And then I was thinking , okay , maybe I'll just go to sleep . And then I woke up the next morning like it was even even worse , basically . So do you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days ? Yeah . Okay . Have you tried anything which has made the headache better ? Um , so I tried , uh , ibuprofen . Um , so I took , like a few , um , for the last two days , basically . That helped , but it doesn't really help . No . In the past , it did help me , which is why I decided to try it , but . Okay . All right . Except for the headaches . Any other symptoms at all ? So , um , any problems with your eyesight or your vision ? Not really , but just when it started , I got this , like , weird shooting lights , and , like , now , like , light is quite annoying . My eyes . So when you say annoying , does it hurt to look ? Look at bright lights . Yeah . Yeah , it hurts . So . Okay . And , um , have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision ? Not loss of vision . I wouldn't say it's just like some lights from shooting lights . Okay . Any nausea or vomiting ? Um , well , I'm like , basically I'm sick with the headache , but I know vomiting . When you say sick , you mean you feel sick ? Okay . Yeah . Yeah . No vomiting . Okay . Any neck pain or neck stiffness ? No . Okay . And any difficulty with speaking or , um , speech ? No . Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs ? No . It's hard to focus though , so I had to take a couple of days off work , actually . Oh , really ? Okay , okay . No problem . Well , I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on . Um , any recent head injuries at all ? Uh , no . Okay . And have you had anything like this before in the past ? Yeah , I mean , headaches , you mean , or similar to similar to this kind of headache ? Yeah . I mean , I've had , but usually after I take , uh , ibuprofen , it kind of goes away , So . But this time it's just not . It's not okay . Don't worry . Um , any temperatures or fevers ? No . Any rashes at all on your skin ? Um , no , not that I've noticed . Okay . And just moving forward , are you otherwise fit and . Well , Adriana , am I . What ? Sorry . Are you fit and well ? Do you have any other medical history ? I think so , it's just a headache . Any history of migraines at all ? Not myself . I've never had a migraine , but my sister and my mum have them quite frequently . Okay . Um , fine . I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second . Before I go any further , can I ask , do you take any regular medication ? Um , no . Are you on the pill ? No . Okay . Do you have any allergies to any medications ? Um , not that I know of . Okay , so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines . Yeah . Are they ? Is that normally well controlled , or are they , um , having difficulty controlling the symptoms . Um , so my sister's , like , better . Like , it kind of is very rare , but my mom's is , like , quite bad . Um , usually when there's , like , a season changing and stuff like that , it's . Yeah , it takes her out for a few days , basically . All right . Okay , fine . Um , socially , tell me a bit more about your life outside of , um , outside of work . So who lives at home with you ? Uh , I live with housemates , so three of them . So we're excellent . And are you working at the moment ? You mentioned this impact on your work . Yeah . So I work well . I work in it . So I work with computers a lot , so it kind of is difficult to focus . Um , I had to , like , reduce the brightness of my screen . Um , okay . Do you wear glasses ? Yes I do . Have any have you had any recent eye check done ? Eye test ? No . Uh , I've been wearing them since I was five , five year old , okay for you to bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining , I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done . Um , I've been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently . Well , it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project , but , um . Yeah , nothing out of the ordinary , really . Okay . All right . Great . Um , regarding smoking or alcohol , do you drink or smoke at all ? I socially smoke , and I drink not only socially , so only socially . Okay . Right now , um , Adriana , do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms ? Have you have you read anything online or spoken to people ? Um . Not really . Um , I first I thought it's stress . Or maybe I didn't drink enough water because sometimes when I don't drink enough water , I get headaches . Um , but I don't think that's it . And I'm , like , worried . It's . I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like from my mom and my sister . And it's really annoying . So I really don't want to have that . And I know it's genetic , so I've researched that . Um , but I don't know if that is the case , so . Yeah . Okay . Is there anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today ? Yeah , maybe just kind of . If you have any recommendations , I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me . Um , usually it gets resolved if I have headache and , like , after , like , 1 or 2 days , but currently , it didn't help me . How many tablets did you take with ibuprofen ? Uh , three a day . Three a day . Okay . All right . Um , so , Adriana . So , um , really what I think is going on here , I unfortunately , I do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine . Um , the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it , given your mum and your sister also have migraines . I think it's something for us to think about . Um , now , I'm not saying it's going to keep happening , but it may just be a one off , but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers . Um , now moving forward , we have some options which we can discuss . Uh , you try the ibuprofen . Now , my only worry is I'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose . You can take up to two tablets three times a day . Oh , right . There's definitely room for improvement there . Or I can prescribe you something stronger , like naproxen , which is another anti-inflammatory , which can be helpful . Um , we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine , which might be helpful as well . Um , yeah . I think codeine is what my mum takes for when she has , um , um , migraines . Okay , so I think it's certainly worth looking into that so I can give you a prescription for that today . Um , with regards to , um , the next few days , it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse . And and , you know , I'd like you to come back and see me in about a week's time , week to two weeks time . If you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches , we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic , which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis . But we can have that discussion next time . Mhm . Okay . Okay . In the meantime , if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse , um , you know , I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner . Okay . Okay . So if you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs , or you're just not feeling very well , just give me a call and come back and see me , okay ? All right . Great . Great . We'll have a good day . Thank you . You too . Bye bye .
