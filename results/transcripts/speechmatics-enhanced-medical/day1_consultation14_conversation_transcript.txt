April , how can I help you this afternoon ? Well , I've just been having this , like , cough for quite a few days , and my nose is running . Um , I've just been super annoying , and it's not going away . Okay . When did it all start ? Uh , I think it started , like , maybe a bit less than a week ago . Like , maybe , maybe 5 or 6 days ago . Okay . And you mentioned a couple of things that you mentioned a cough . You mentioned a bit of a runny nose . Is that right ? Yeah . Okay . Let's focus on your cough first . Can you tell me a bit more about your cough ? Uh , it's just so continuous . It's really , really frustrating . It's quite dry and it's just all day , like , keeps me up at night as well , which is really annoying . Okay , so it's a dry cough . So you're not bringing up any . You're not bringing up any . Oh , I can hear that . Yeah . And you're not bringing up any , phlegm or anything like that . No . Okay . So keep you up at night . Um , you mentioned , uh , the cold symptoms as well . The runny nose . Do you have do you have a sore throat at all ? I mean , apart from the coughing is giving me a sore throat , but it's not like , you know , not more than than that , you know , just just my throat is irritated from coughing , but it's not like it's not that bad when I swallow or anything . Right . Do you have any , um . Are you how are your ears ? Your ears feel blocked or . No . They feel okay , actually . Yeah . No pain or discharge is not paying . Not paying on the ears . Okay . All right . Um , fine . In terms of your breathing , um , how is your breathing ? How's your chest ? Is your breathing more labored ? Um , I don't think so . Like , I guess , like , it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe , but , like , not . Yeah , I don't think so . When you walk around . You don't feel breathless , do you ? I don't feel breathless . No , I feel , you know , generally tired . Okay . Okay . Yeah , but not not anything special with my chest . Any pain in your chest ? No , no , not that either . Okay . You mentioned feeling tired . Um , have you felt feverish at all ? Have you had a temperature ? Um . I've been having , like , like shivers . Even when I'm in . When I'm in bed , you know , like when you when you go to sleep and you feel like I should be warm , but I'm still still , you know , shivering a little bit , but I haven't taken my temperature , so I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever , but it feels like I probably did because I was just . I was next to my boyfriend , and he was completely warm and totally fine , and I just , like , couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on . And I was still cold . Oh , dear . Okay , okay . All right . Um , fine . In terms of any other symptoms , have you had any nausea ? Have you had any vomiting ? No . No , no . Not yet . No vomiting . Like , um . Yeah . Nothing like that . How's your appetite ? Um . I mean , it's okay . I at the beginning , like , when I was starting to have the the symptoms , the the coughing and stuff , um , I had a little bit of diarrhea . Um , but but I didn't it didn't cut my appetite or anything . I just like my stomach wasn't feeling great . Okay . As I got better now the diarrhea . Yeah . Yeah , it got better . It was only like the first . Like it started at the same time as the cough started , and then it stopped . So I thought everything would be fine . But then the cops just kept going . Okay , fine . Um , any problems with your waterworks at all ? With my what are your your waterworks ? Your urine ? Oh , uh , no , no , no . That's fine . You're passing urine . Okay . You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine . Okay . Yeah , I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea . Now that it stopped , I just went back to normal . Okay . All right . Um , in terms of any other things you've noticed , any any funny skin rashes or , um , problems with your muscles or joints ? Uh , like my , you know , when I have , when I was telling you I had , like , the , I had chills and I was really cold . My muscle was really hurting . Okay , I do Pilates , but , like , it's hurting me so much at the moment . Right . Um , but to be honest , all I feel like doing is just lying in bed . Right . Okay . Okay . I'm sorry . It must be very difficult for you . Yeah . Great . Especially like in my arms . My legs ? Like , just everywhere . Basically quite lethargic and weak . Mentioned . Yeah . Pretty much . Okay . And , um . April , are you normally otherwise fit and . Well . Am I normally what fit and . Well . So do you have any other medical history ? Uh , well , I have type two diabetes . Okay . And I'm quite high blood pressure . Okay . And what do you take for your blood pressure ? and what medications do you take on a regular basis ? Should I say , um , I take metformin for the diabetes . I take lisinopril for the high blood pressure . Lisinopril . Okay , fine . Any allergies at all to medications ? No . Allergies ? No . Okay . Regarding any family history , is there anything I should be aware of ? Um , my dad also has type two diabetes , but I think that's it . Okay . All right . Who's looking after your diabetes ? Is there anyone ? Do you have a doctor in hospital for diabetes ? Yeah , I just regularly go see a doctor . Um , and just checks up on it . Same with the high blood pressure . Like I have it under control . And since I've started taking this medication , I've just been , like , regularly checking that it's . It's under control . Great . Excellent . In terms of your social situation , who lives at home with you ? Uh , just it's just me and my partner lives . Okay . Um , fine . Is your partner . Well , at the moment . Yeah . He has none of this . Like , he's just going ahead , like . Like nothing . Nothing . Like , I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him , but . Right . Not the diary and nothing . He's fine . Go away . He's got away with it at the moment . Okay . And are you working at the moment , April ? Uh , yeah , I am working . But the first day I skipped because . Because I was feeling just too shit . Yeah . Um . But then I just felt like I had to go back because I had so much to do . Mhm . I've been going in , but it's not been fun . No , I can imagine . What is it that you do for work ? Uh , I am a developer . Oh , so you work in the IT field ? Okay . Yeah . Work in it . It . Right . Okay . Not too active a job ? No . Has it been quite stressful recently ? Not more than usual . I don't think it's related to stress . Like , I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work currently . Um , the reason I ask is sometimes to take a day off to try and recover . So . Yeah , I don't think that's the reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system . Um , but it's good to know you're not feeling stressed . Um . Do you smoke at all ? April , I used to , but I've stopped for about six months now . Okay . Um . And what about alcohol ? I mean , yeah , I don't think I drink that much . I don't really know how you count the units , but I guess , like , I don't drink more than , like , like , say , three evenings a week , and I rarely get , like , properly drunk or anything . And what is it that you drink ? Wine , mostly . And wine . How much do you drink on those nights ? Uh , I'd say like maybe 2 or 3 glasses . Okay . So , um . Yeah . So you probably just about under the limit of , um , the recommended limit . Something to think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes . Maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can . Yeah . Overall , I think I should cut down on it ? Really ? Ideally , the right answer is to cut down completely . But in practice , I know that's not realistic . So maybe for the first few weeks when you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter , um , and if you are coping okay , then we can maybe try and cut down altogether . Okay . Okay . Just something for you to think about . Um . Right . So just as we wrap up , really , um , April , I think based on your story , I think essentially , I think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness . Um , I don't think there's anything to worry about . You know , you've had a bit of a cough , a bit of a runny nose , feeling quite weak and lethargic . I'm hoping that , you know , you're probably over the worst of it now . It's been five days . I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days . Normally last about a week to ten days . What should I do if it just keeps going on and on ? Like if it's still going on in , say , four days ? Yeah , absolutely . So , you know , things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to , you know , get some nice good rest , drink plenty of fluids . Keep yourself well hydrated . You can take regular paracetamol if you feel like it's still not getting any better in 2 to 3 days , it's probably worth coming back to see me again . We can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better , then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest , which can sometimes be a common source of infection . Um , do you think I should keep going to work , or do you think I should just . Yeah . So I think , you know , really , I think it depends on you . If it's , um , if you are coughing , then there is a theatrical , you know , risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still . So I would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can , and get some good bed rest . Um , and maybe think about work early next week . Okay . Okay . But if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse , I want you to come back and see me sooner . Okay ? Okay . But otherwise , I don't need to worry . No , no , no . Nothing to worry about otherwise . Okay . All right . Thank you very much . Have a good day . Appreciate it . Thank you . Bye .
