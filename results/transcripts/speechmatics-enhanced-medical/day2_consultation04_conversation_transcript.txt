Um , are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment ? Yes . Okay . Fantastic . All right , so tell me what's been going on . You said you're a bit short of breath . Is that right ? Yeah , yeah . Feeling very sort of breathless recently . Um , like , I don't know , whenever I , like , breathe deeply , I , it sort of catches in the right hand side of my back . Right . Okay . Okay . And how long has this been going on ? For now . Just . Just a day . Really ? Right . Okay . Any other symptoms at the same time you've had this pain ? Um , well , I've had I've got a bit of a slight fever . Um , and I feel like I coughed up a bit of blood on on two occasions . Right . Okay . So what that means . Okay . All right . It might . It might all be connected then . Um , and , um , yesterday , before this , all of this . You're completely fine . Um , yeah , yeah . Kind of . I sort of feel my heart beating , but other than that , no . Sort of . Fine . Okay , so you can feel your heart beating a bit faster than normal . Is that . I don't know , I can just sort of feel it . Sure . Okay . Um . But I've also . I've been feeling a bit , like , a bit tired at work . Haven't really been like , exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired . Um , and . Yeah , performing . Performing daily activities has been a bit harder than usual . Okay . All right . And , um , how long has that been for the tiredness and not wanting to exercise . Um , only after , only for a couple of weeks or so . Couple of weeks . Okay . And then the last day or so . That's when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you've got some blood . Okay . All right . Um , you said you felt a bit warm . Have you measured your temperature at all ? Um , with the back of my hand . Yeah . Just with that . Okay . Fair enough . All right . Um , okay . And now , can I just ask , um , do you smoke at all ? Uh , no . Okay . What do you work as ? Um . I work in an office . Just a desk job . Okay . All right . And , um , do you live alone ? Uh , yes . Yeah . In a flat or a house flat . Okay . Do you have any pets ? Cat a cat . Okay . Um , are you on any medication at all ? Regular medication ? Uh , yeah . Um . Methotrexate . Methotrexate . Methotrexate . Okay . What are you on that for ? Um , I've got SL . SL . Okay . Do you have any other diagnoses ? Any other illnesses at all ? No . Right . Okay . Um , and do you have any allergies to any medication ? No . Any other allergies at all ? No . Okay . So , um , you're you're taking methotrexate at the moment . When was the last time you had methotrexate ? Uh , this morning . Oh , you had this morning . Okay . All right . All right . Okay . Um , um , a couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and , um , get an idea of how unwell you are . Okay . Um , the first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse . So the way we're going to do this is that if you . If I can get you to try and locate the pulse on your wrist . Okay . Not everyone can do this . So don't worry if you can't . But if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse , it's just under the thumb . If you put two fingers up and down like that , you might be able to feel the pulse . I've got it . You've got it . Okay . Are you sure ? Yeah . All right . So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting . Okay , so I'll just get my stopwatch up . Okay . So if you can , um , you've still got the pulse . Yep . Okay , so if you can start counting now , please . One . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . Seven . Eight . Nine . Ten . 11 . If you can stop now . I think that was about 11 or 12 . Um , so that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74 . That's that's okay . Good . Fantastic . And the next thing I'd like you to try and do . Okay . Um , it depends on the lighting . So it may not be possible , but I'd like to try and do is just get you to squeeze the tip of your finger , and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back . Okay . So if you can see what I'm doing now , my fingers come right behind the screen . I'm squeezing it . Okay . Just watch me first . Just watch me first . Yeah , I'm squeezing it . And then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour . Okay . So if I can get you just to put your finger up to your camera and then with the other hand , just try and squeeze it and you've got very good circulation . Okay . Okay . Perfect . That's great . Thank you so much . The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat . Okay . Are you doing this consultation via , um , a phone or laptop ? Okay . A phone . I tested it on my laptop , so I think we're good to go . So say that again . Got a laptop ? Okay . Okay , so if you if you , um , position your device up above your head , put your head back , mouth open wide , and let me see if I can have this . That's fantastic . Say , ah . Ah . Perfect . Thank you for that . Excellent . Lovely . Okay , last thing is , if I can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here . Okay . Uh , by your Adam's apple . Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not . No , I feel pretty normal to me . Okay , I think . All right . Um , now , Um . Uh , sorry , I've forgotten your name . Um . Doris . Doris . Doris . So , Doris , um , what I think we need to do is , um . This sounds like you might have a chest infection . Okay . If you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing , um , uh , I think you need to be examined today . Someone needs to listen to your chest and , um , maybe check your blood pressure as well and check that you're stable . I have to say , examining you now , from what ? Limited examination I could do online . Your . Everything does seem to be okay in terms of . You don't seem acutely unstable . However , if you've got this kind of pain , um , when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood , we we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have pneumonia or chest infection . And that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope . And you may need an antibiotic . This is one thing I need to ask you . Have you been on any long haul flight recently ? No . No . Okay . Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lungs ? Blood clots . Not that I know of . No . Okay . Anyone in the family have that ? No . No . Okay . All right . Um , what I think we'll do is , um , we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today . Okay . Um , I would like someone to listen to your chest and check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well . Just make sure and check your temperature . Make sure all those parameters are okay . You may well need an antibiotic . Okay . Um , do you have any allergies to any antibiotics ? No . No . Okay . Um . I'm not I'm going to not I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first . Um , before we proceed to the next step . But that's what I would predict the next step might be . Um , I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team , and then they will book you in for a face to face appointment with one of our GPS today . And then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there . Okay . But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer . Um , uh , given the the way in which you have presented . Now , just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the blood in the phlegm . That's not usually how lung cancer is present . It's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms . Um , however , we might need to get some investigations to exclude that . It depends on the examination findings when we see you . Okay . All right . Are you worried about lung cancer ? Well , you know , you start coughing up blood and you think you're gonna die of lung cancer , so . Of course . Yeah . So just remind me how old you are again . I'm sorry . 45 . 45 . Okay . It's something we do need to be cognizant of . Okay . Um , and we may end up having to do a follow up chest x ray if things don't settle down . But at the moment , it seems more like a chest infection rather than lung cancer . That's good to know . Yeah , that is good to know . Yes , because that's easier to treat . But we still need to make sure that things are okay , because chest infections can become nasty as well and can lead to infection inside the body . We want to avoid that as well . So let's get you checked out today , and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment . Perfect . Thank you very much . All right . You're welcome . All right . Take care then . All the best . Bye .
