And what was the last bit ? Your address ? Um , it's one Babylon Avenue . And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today ? Yes . Can I do for you ? Um . Come in . I don't really know what's been going on , but it's just aching all over for . Definitely the last six weeks . It might have been slightly longer than that , but it's just sort of that feeling . Really tired . Rundown . Okay . Um , so when do you think you were last ? Well , uh , where are we now ? We just started April . Uh , definitely Christmas , New Year . I felt relatively well , I think . Um , so since then , actually , Yeah , I , I was on holiday in , um , in the States and yeah , it probably coincided with some time around then end of January , start of February . So do you think it started when you're on holiday or after you got back ? Uh , probably a couple of weeks after I got back . Were you ? Well , when you're on holiday ? Yeah . Had a had a great time . Very active . Um , did you get any infections , chest infections , diarrhoea , vomiting , anything like that ? Um , no , not that I recall . Um , yeah . Not . No .

Any persistent cold symptoms or earache , sore throat , chest , chest , cough , shortness of breath , phlegm , anything like that ? Uh , no . Any change in your weight at all ? Um , I don't think so . I'm probably less hungry , but no . No weight change . Just a bit . Are you eating different amounts ? Uh , yeah . Probably slightly smaller portions or . Yeah .

Now , there was , uh . In fact , I've got a photo , um , on my phone , if that's helpful . Okay . I can try and show you . Hang on . Um . Because this . Yeah , this was weird . This sort of came up and then , uh , disappeared after a couple of weeks . Where's the light ? I don't know that . Okay . Yeah . Whereabouts was it ? Uh , I think sort of calf back of my calf because I didn't notice it . My wife noticed it , actually . When did you first notice it ? Um , probably , uh , around the end of February . The middle to end of February . And then it , like , it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time , and I it faded over a couple of weeks , I guess . Did you have any fevers at that time ? Um . I to be honest , that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat . I had , um , so possibly a little bit feverish , but I , I sort of put it down to that . Do you know where you got that when it started ? Had you been walking ? Did you get any bites that you noticed ? Uh , I like I do quite a lot of walking , and we did , um , quite a lot while we were out in the on holiday as well , but definitely , um , yeah . I mean , I don't recall any . I don't remember seeing anything fitting . But you often like . Yeah . As you're walking through . I was in shorts and boots , but . Whereabouts were you in the States ? Um , just sort of , uh , near Yosemite . So . Okay . And any headaches ? Blurred vision , tingling , numbness ? Um , no . The sort of headache , maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy . Oh . That's better . And have you been able to go to work ? As usual ? Um , I've been going to work . I don't know how effective it's been , but . Yeah . And what's your job ? Um , I work for a health technology company , actually . Okay . And has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work ? Yeah , definitely . Sort of tired and , um . Yeah . Less energy . Sort of . Probably less engaged than I would normally be . Have you been able to exercise ? Okay . Um . Not as much . I don't know if it's . I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it . I'm not exercising as much as I would normally . Okay . And , um , how's your mental health ? Your stress levels , uh , are pretty good at the moment , actually . Like , previously , that has been an issue . But , um , other than sort of physically feeling a bit , uh , crappy , I've . Yeah , in a pretty good place . Okay . Apart from that rash , any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints ? Uh , yeah . Sort of aching . Shoulders . Back , hips , knees , but sort of . Yeah . Not swelling that you've noticed ? No . Hands . Wrists . Ankles . Toes . Uh , no . Okay . Um . And any other significant medical problems in the past ? are hay fever ? Asthma and hay fever if they count okay . Any flare ups of asthma recently known ? Pretty well controlled . Do you take any regular inhalers or other medication ? Yeah , I've got one of those , um , preventers , I think . Yeah . Um , which I take twice a day , but I've not used my . You haven't been using it . I haven't , I've been using the every day for the morning and night , but not the , uh , salbutamol . Not . Okay . And any , um . Do you take any other medications ? Um , so I take , um . One of the anti-histamines . Can't remember which it might be . Can I get that from ? Just from the pharmacy ? Yeah . That's fine . Um . And do you smoke ? No . Drinking alcohol ? Uh . Nope . So occasionally that was okay . And who do you live with at home ? Uh , just my wife . Um . Sorry . Um , so with this rash , we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms . And just because of your symptoms , which have been ongoing for six weeks , that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels . Um , I think it's important to get some blood tests , checking all the normal things like liver , kidneys , blood count , etc. but also some more specific things like , um , bacterial infection you can sometimes get , including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that . So that would involve blood tests . Are you happy to do that ? Uh , yeah . I'm in general happy with blood tests . What's the infection ? Well , you can get , uh , you can get bacterial infection caused , which is called , um , It's called Lyme disease that you can get a rash from a tick bite . So that's something you would do a test for as well . Okay . And if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it . So it's definitely worth checking for . But we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy , tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks . Okay . So if you're happy to do that , if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test , arrange a follow up about a week after after you've had the test done . Okay . So do the test first and then and that follow up we can just do over the phone again . Yeah . Yeah , we can do that over the phone to start with . Okay . Excellent . Okay . That's really helpful . Thank you very much . Oh , sorry . You broke up a bit . Any other questions ? Oh no . Not . No . Okay . That's great . Take care , take care . Thank you . Bye . Sorry .
